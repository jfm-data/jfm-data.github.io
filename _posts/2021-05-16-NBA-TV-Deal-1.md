CNBC reporter, Jabari Young, [recently published an article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/nba-is-next-up-for-a-big-rights-increase-and-75-billion-is-the-price.html#:~:text=Early%20thinking%20within%20league%20circles,partners%20Turner%20Sports%20and%20ESPN.) announcing the NBA is eyeing a hefty $75B haul from the next broadcast rights deal.
To me, this is a signal that current negotiations aren't going well with its exisiting partners. The annonymous quotes, the startling figures, and its dubious timing all reek of graft.
I suspect the NBA floated this message in an attempt to apply some pressure on ESPN and TNT who might be getting cold feet. If this is the case, I wouldn't blame the networks amidst the conspicuous changes and uncertainly in the entertainment landscape. The once dominant pay-TV business model has been in trouble for years and 2020 may have signalled that the tipping point for streaming platforms becoming the preeminent in-home entertainment prodcut. The threat posed by these cheaper on-demand services may be existential to cable, which means entering a $8B billion a year deal through 2034 risks catastrophe for both the networks and the negotiating executives.

The troubled outlook for the NBA's next TV deal can be examined by the rapid decline young people watching TV. [Pew Research tracked](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/03/17/cable-and-satellite-tv-use-has-dropped-dramatically-in-the-u-s-since-2015/) that in 2021 only 34% 18-29 year olds have pay-TV at home -- a 52% drop from just 2015. A perhaps more striking representation of cable's disconnect with young viewers is the rapid demise of MTV's cultural relevance. From its inception in 1981,
MTV had been an influential pillar of teen popular culture. The rise of YouTube and social media influencers left MTV dispensible to the children raised online. MTV's once must-see event programming faded into a wasteland of gimmicky reality TV targeted to the last (and ageing) generation of kids who had watched earnestly.
I suspect if we indexed the year when MTV stopped being fashionable for teens, we would notice an accelerated decline in pay-TV subs happening somewhere in
the 5 to 8-year mark. And this is just the present state, so a scary thought for TV network executives is to mentally forecast the demographics and sub counts at the ~25-year mark --a point when the next NBA broadcast deal would still be ripe.

The annual compounding effects from not adding new young subscribers should give anxiety to any network executive considering long-term deals. Then factor this with
 expected leakage from older chord-cutters and things get real ugly. [Statista tracked and forecasted US pay-TV subscribers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251268/number-of-pay-tv-households-in-the-us/) and estimated the number of subs to fall to 60 million by 2025. That would be a 40% drop from its peak subscriber rate and near the time when the last NBA deal was negotiated. If we calculated and applied a CAGR to the deal's midpoint in 2030 we get 48 million subs, and extending this to the end of the deal in 2034, the counts drop below 40 million. 

So, just from performing back of the envelope math, the NBA is seeking 3X the money when its partners are expected to generate half the revenue at the deal's midpoint. These companies are no longer cash cows with a natural monopoly on in-home entertainment, so it's difficult to imagine how they could suddenly afford to pay the diszzying asking price. ESPN and Turner have made opperating cuts that layed off hunderds of employees and cancelled programs -- these actions should mark of their new economic realities and if anyting apply downward pressue on long-term contracts. The NBA may believe its feasible that prices increases are a solution, except that the robust competitive environment customer price sensitiviy is high and it might accelerate chord cutting. 
Now, Young's article might just be the league posturing to combat the negative news surrounding their lacklustre ratings. However, if they are sincere, Adam Silver is badly over playing his hand which may come back to hurt him. In my next blog I'll share my reasoning why the streaming services are not viable options and will not be providing them any leverage against the networks.

Until then..
