It is well past time that we say goodbye to Nova Scotia's "top doctor" and his aimless and vain public health policies.
A free society should have demand the resignation of the heavy-handed doctor long ago, yet with the media's weakness for
worshiping the heads of public health bureaucracies, Dr. Strang is a local deity above reproach. His public image as saviour means that any
negative judgement of the man or his policies is constitued as hate speech. All offenders will be prosecuted in the court of public opinion.

The pitchforks came for me when I tried to engage to the Redditors of r/Halifax over his (poor) performance as the "Top Doc". In a post, I asked the community whether the incoming Premier should consider replacing him for this overbearing policies that could be refuted with peer-reviewed science. Sadly the mods never published the post (no reason given, mind you). The censorship forced me move the dicussion to the daily COVID-19 case count threads where my comments were met with ad hominem attacks and down votes. They tried to dismiss me as some alt-right crackpot but *none* attempted to argue on the substance of my comments. While defending my position with science and data, something they know little about, I received a DM from a user to tell me my responses were no longer showing up in the thread... and not longer after that, I couldn't post anything at all. I had been shadowbanned by the mods.
  
Sadly, Strang being an untouchable is just not contained to the mania-fuel message boards. The behaviour was on display for all Nova Scotians when the top ER doctor in Cape Breton, 
Dr. Chris Milburn, openly questioned Dr. Strang's decision to close schools on public radio. In the [CBC Radio One panel discussion](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-24-information-morning-cape-breton/clip/15848671-issue-panel-anna-manley-candee-mccarthy-chris), Dr. Milburn outlined how there is no scientific justification 
for school closures, raised concerns about the social cost, the inequities it drives, and called out leadership for not performing a cost-benefit analysis.
The host and panellist eagerly came to the defence of Strang (of course, the CBC host introduced the topic as "Did schools re-open too soon?"). 
Dr. Milburn shot down all points with facts, reason, and logic -- yet there remained an unease from the panel who realized they were too close to a Dr. Strang heritic. 

Since his CBC Radio discussion, Dr. Milburn has been relentlessly attacked by Redditors, Facebookers, and social media trolls. It is hard to find any online discourse about
Dr. Milburn following his criticism of Strang that is not trying to discredit him or call him an idiot. Soon after a petition was started to remove Dr. Milburn as head of the ER in the CBRM. I found his reponse to the social media backlash eloquent:  
>*"What I'm for is science, and what I'm for is personal choice ......Patient autonomy is one of the basic, ethical foundations of our modern health care system"*.- Dr. Chris Milburn
>
However the media seemed happy to comply with mob in assisting the character assassination. The CBC had buried Dr. Mliburn's criticisms and his own defence while amplifying Dr. Strang's empty rebuttal during hourly news updates. Sadly, like his devout followers, Dr.Strag never addressed the concerns or the science and data that Dr. Milburn raised on the radio interview -- he only made the proclamation that **HE** was the public health expert, not Milburn.


So after 16-months of doing the same thing over-and-over (and failing), Strang should step down and allow a medical professional capable of assessing social and economic costs of restrictions while determining an appropriate level of risk. A simple fool could have declared the lock-it-down strategy of his as it takes no nuance or moral courage to consider. In fact, the media and public seem to praise him as a hero whenever he annouces a new restriction. Without the freedom to critique Strang or his policies on a public platform ostensibly makes him the despot of Nova Scotia -- a role he seems reluctant to relinquish. At the end of the radio interview, Dr. Milburn posited soemthing that I had said months ago: Dr. Strang policies are driven by ego and power, not reputable science. Given his love the the limelight, I suspect he will be the last CMO to give up his unwarranted powers. It is reprehensible what the media and the masses have made of this man -- and even worse, his critics. I just hope they will wear the shame of his consequences when they are finally exposed.

**UPDATE - 1** -- The cancel culture mobsters and Dr. Strang's fragile ego ultimately got to Dr. Milburn and his position as [department head of emergency medicine for the Eastern zone](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/cape-breton-doctor-removed-as-head-of-emergency-medicine-for-eastern-zone-1.5473738). A truly sad and pathetic response to a common sense converstation about Strang's policies. Dr. Milburn's wife, Dr. Julie Curwin, [wrote a well-written op-ed](https://www.saltwire.com/cape-breton/opinion/local-perspectives/dr-julie-curwin-who-will-speak-for-covid-marginalized-patients-after-firing-of-sydney-er-chief-100602623/) raising more concerns over Dr. Despot's decisions. Now the that she stuck her head in the guilotine, it's only a matter of time before they get her too.   

**UPDATE - 2** -- I shared this article on r/NovaScoita which started a robust discussion, but the post lasted for less than 24hrs. I was banned and the post was taken down by the mods. When I asked them why, I was told sharing a link to this blog was conisdered spamming ðŸ™„. The cognitive dissonance is unbelievable.
