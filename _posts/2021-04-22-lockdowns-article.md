Today Nova Scoita's provicial goverment announced severe lockdown measures for the municipality of Halifax. Having recently spoken to a friend furstratingly enduring the Ontario lockdown, I am upset at the decision to say the least. Not that it will affect my life too much, but it is just simply horrible policy without and substantive evidence that it does any good. At best, lockdowns only delay problems with COVID-19, but these draconian policies create whole host of new problems that are not 'temporary' and will linger for months or years.

So lets jump to the problems they are creating: So far I have seen at least a dozen businesses close due to these measures, and I am sure there are hunderds on the brink of financial ruin. These are businesses that took a lifetime to build and provide livlihoods to thousands of Nova Scoitas. When these close there is no coming back. Perhaps new businesses will replace them in time, but meanwhile the large corporations will eat their lunch. A goverment bailout would be a disaster and doesn't solve the core problem -- it is just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic while effecitly subsidizing large corporates(like Amazon) to serve public needs with taxpayer funds. Not to mention that these lockdowns are creating a widing economic disparity between the working class and white collar workers who work from home. Those working from home are saving thousands -- and most are growing trough real estate, equaities a, and speculative cryopto.. Meahwile customer serivce saving business are losing paycheques and are sturggling ot pay rents.which are being invested in real estate and equties. money can can invest in equality and real estance. Meanwhile 

Other problems: mental health problems from soical isolation, domesitc abuse, child abuse, gluttony, just ot name a few. These will have lasting concequences.
