So I recently dealt with a health scare with my dog, Hunter. He's not clear of long-term problems, but as if now he is past the point where 
I thought I might lose him. The situation made me reflect on dog ownership and my connection with him.

### A Little About Hunter
My dog is a Aussie Mountain Doodle -- that is, he's an Australian Shepard x Bernese Mountain Dog x Poodle Mix. Or as a possibly intoxicated vagrant bypasser said, "oh, a Heinz 57." He has varying looks depending on the season, in the winter he's an 85-pound black and white furball, and when shaved in the summer he's somewhere between a dalmatian and a chupacabra.
Pieces of his nature seemed to have been inherited from his linage breeds. He's affectionate, alert, active, social, and intelligent. 

He is most spirited when I take him to the dog park -- a place where he used to get bullied (a little), but at full-size, he fears no other dogs. He'll run and play with many there  --sniffing and marking over other dogs' scents. I have never worried about him during a scuffle. While he can look like a goofy big teddy bear, I've seen him pin larger German Shepherds and Rottweilers repeatedly in play. Even if the aggression escalates I feel confident in his own restraint and his ability to defend himself. His only real incident at the park was when a puppy pitbull locked his jaw on the scruff of his neck. Hunter was calm but annoyed -- moving around as the pitbull was hanging off him with forepaws suspended in the air. As you might expect a "pit mom" to act (and look, tbh), she didn't see a problem. After I couple of minutes of not letting go, I had to forcibly remove the pitbull myself, which stirred the pit mon to make a scene because according to her, pibbles wasn't hurting him. 

Hunter's full of character. He's extremely social and playful. This makes him trusting of anyone approaching him -- and eager to get their attention if they're dispensing treats. He also loves children. His breeders had three daughters who raised him from the womb which must have left a lasting impression on him. He's is keen to approach kids, like my niece, but his status as a 'giant dog' is intimidating for her and others.
  
I have grown up with a Bichon Friese and later a Golden Retriever, but Hunter really stands out. My dad -- who loved his Golden -- often calls Hunter "the best dog" when I visit. The one characteristic that really stands out is Hunter's intelligence. Not only was easy to train, but he's a quick problem solver. Just a few weeks ago he demonstrated his skill while playing fetch over an icy snow-covered field. After taking a direct line for the ball, he looked back at me and ran west to a crescent-shaped beaten path. Despite it being a much longer distance he solved it was the optimal route over the direct line. 

Of course, there is a flip side of his canny. It's hard to sneak out or have a bite without his notice. I am always amazed at how well he anticipates my actions. Before I even have my shoes on to go out he'll be sitting in front of the door with a melancholy look of abandonment.

My relationship with him is special. He's not my "fur baby" nor am I his "father", but I recognize that to him, I am his best buddy. He never proves ungrateful or treacherous, and he is most elated when I return home -- even if I was gone for only 10 minutes. His affection is a constant presence in years of uncertianty.

I am grateful to have gotten him before COVID and lucky he is such a great dog. I stay active and lean by the countless miles we've walked and jogged -- and have met new people and friends through his outgoing nature. If anyone thinks about getting a dog, be sure to consider this crazy mix if you have energy for it.
