It is well past time that we say goodbye to Dr. Strang and his anxious, authoritarian, and counteractive public health policies.
The heavy-handedness of his "COVID-safe" restrictions in a free society should have forced a resignation months ago. Yet with the media's proclivity for
fetishizing the heads of public health bureaucracies, Dr. Strang has become a local deity above reproach. 
The state of allowable discourse has gotten so absurd that any negative judgement of Strang is treated as hate speech -- and might even cost you your job.   

I have experienced the Strang backlash while trying to engage to the Redditors of r/Halifax with whether the incoming Premier should consider replacing "Top Doc". I listed a few gentle criticisms of Dr. Strang's policies with referential material that refuted his cause for restrictions. I hoped to engage in civil debate, but sadly the mods never published the post (no reason given mind you). The censorship forced me move the dicussion to the daily COVID-19 case count threads where my comments were met with ad hominem attacks and down votes. They tried to label me as some alt-right crackpot but *none* attempted to argue the substance of my comments. Shortly after, I received a DM to tell me my responses were no longer showing up in the thread... and not longer after that, I couldn't post anything at all-- I was shadowbanned by the mods.
  
Sadly, Strang being an untouchable is just not contained to the mania-fuel message boards. The behaviour was on exhibit when the top ER doctor in Cape Breton, 
Dr. Chris Milburn, openly questioned Dr. Strang's decision to close schools on public radio. In the [CBC Radio One panel discussion](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/live-radio/1-24-information-morning-cape-breton/clip/15848671-issue-panel-anna-manley-candee-mccarthy-chris), Dr. Milburn outlined how there is no scientific justification 
for school closures, raised concerns about the social cost, the inequities that lockdowns' drive, and called out leadership for not performing a cost-benefit analysis on these policies. 
The host and panellist eagerly came to the defence of Strang (of course, the CBC host was framing the topic as "Did schools re-open too soon?" and he was supportive of vaccine passports despite the panel legal expert saying it was a horrible Charter violation). 
Dr. Milburn shot down all points with facts, reason, and logic -- yet there remained a disquiet from the panel who emanated contempt for the MD spoiling the narrative. 

Since his CBC Radio discussion, Dr. Milburn has been relentlessly attacked by Redditors, Facebookers, and social media trolls. It is hard to find any discourse about
Dr. Milburn following his criticism of Strang that is not trying to discredit him or call him an idiot.
One Reddit user posted a thread titled "Dr. Chris Milburn is an idiot" which was filled comments of personal insults, questioned his credentials, and dug up any past aggrievances.  
Soon after a petition was started to remove Dr. Milburnas head of the ER in the CBRM. His response was to the soical meida backlash was *"What I'm for is science and what I'm for is personal choice ......Patient autonomy is one of the basic, ethical foundations of our modern health care system"*.
However the media seems happy to comply with the continuted character assassination of Dr. Milburn. The CBC had buried Dr. Mliburn's criticisms and his own defence while amplifying Dr. Strang's empty rebuttal during hourly news updates -- which like his devoted defenders, did not address the science and data.


Dr. Strang should step down and allow a medical professional capable of assessing the social and economic costs while determining an appropriate level of risk. A simple fool could have come up with the lock-it-down strategy as it takes no nuance or courage to consider. The fact that there cannot be any public discourse on his power over ~1M people ostensibly designates him the despot of Nova Scotia -- a role he is reluctant to relinquish. At the end of the radio interview, Dr. Milburn posited soemthing that I had said months ago: Dr. Strang policies are driven by his lust for power rather than eputable science. It is reprehensible what the media and the masses have made of this man -- and his critics! -- I just hope they will wear the shame of his consequences when they are exposed.

**UPDATE - 1** -- The cancel culture mobsters and Dr. Strang's fragile ego ultimately got to Dr. Milburn and his position as [department head of emergency medicine for the Eastern zone](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/cape-breton-doctor-removed-as-head-of-emergency-medicine-for-eastern-zone-1.5473738). A truly sad and pathetic response to a common sense converstation about Strang's policies. Dr. Milburn's wife, Dr. Julie Curwin, [wrote a well-written op-ed](https://www.saltwire.com/cape-breton/opinion/local-perspectives/dr-julie-curwin-who-will-speak-for-covid-marginalized-patients-after-firing-of-sydney-er-chief-100602623/) raising more concerns over Dr. Despot's decisions. Now the that she stuck her head in the guilotine, it's only a matter of time before they get her too.   

**UPDATE - 2** -- I shared this article on r/NovaScoita and was attacked by some idiots, but was surprised by the support and traction. The post lasted for less than 24hrs before the mods took it down and banned me. When I asked what I did and why they didn't ban the user personally attacking me (a clear voilation of thier rules) --they said it was because I was spamming ðŸ™„.
