It is well past time that we say goodbye to Dr. Strang and his anxious, authoritarian, and counteractive public health policies.
The heavy-handedness of his "COVID-safe" restrictions in  a free and open society should have forced a resignation months ago, yet with the media's proclivity for
fetishizing the heads of public health bureaucracies, Dr. Strang has become a local deity above reproach. 
It has gotten so absurd that any judgement of Strang that's not glowing, is treated as hate speech.   

I have experienced this firsthand while trying to engage to the Redditors of r/Halifax by asking if the incoming Premier should consider replacing Dr. Strang. I listed gentle criticisms of Dr. Strang's policies with referenced material that refuted his cause for restrictions. I hoped to engage in civil debate, but sadly the mods never published the post (of course, without providing a reason). The censorship forced me move the dicussion to the daily COVID-19 numbers threads where my comments were met with ad hominem attacks and down votes. Most tried to label me as some alt-right crackpot but none actually tried to argue the substance of my comments. I received a few DMs from one clueless person who knew nothing of science, and another to tell me my responses were no longer showing up in the thread. Soon after that, I couldn't post anything -- I was shadowbanned.
  
Sadly, Strang being an untouchable is just not contained to the mania-fuel message boards. Recently the behaviour was on exhibit when the top ER doctor in Cape Breton, 
Dr. Chris Milburn, openly questioned Dr. Strang's decision to close schools. In the CBC Radio panel discussion, Dr. Milburn outlined how there is no scientific justification 
for school closures, raised concerns about the social costs, the inequities it drives, and then called him (and Rankin) out for not performing a cost-benefit analysis on these policies. 
The host and panellist eagerly came to the defence of Strang (of course, the CBC host was framing the topic as "Did schools re-open too soon?"). 
Dr. Milburn shot down all their points with facts, reason, and logic -- yet there remained a disquiet from the panel who emanated contempt for the MD spoiling the narrative. 

Since his CBC Radio discussion, Dr. Milburn has been relentlessly attacked by Redditors, Facebookers, and social media trolls. It is hard to find any discourse about
Dr. Milburn following his criticism of Dr. Strang, that is not trying to discredit him or call him an idiot.
One Reddit user, I_AM_SQUID, posted a thread titled "Dr. Chris Milburn is an idiot". The thread was filled with personal insults and questioned his credentials.  
In the following days, a petition was started to remove Dr. Milburn from his position as the head of the ER in the CBRM. 
The media has been complicit in this character assassination of Dr. Milburn. The CBC had buried Dr. Mliburn's criticisms while amplifying Dr. Strang's empty rebuttal on an hourly basis, which like his devoted defenders,
did not address the science and data that Dr. Milburn referenced. 


Dr. Strang's policies are driven by as much scientific evidence as a tarot card reader. He needs to step down and allow a medical professional capable of assessing the social and economic costs while determining an appropriate level of data-driven restrictions. A simple fool could have come up with the lock-it-down strategy as it takes no nuance or courage to consider. The fact that there cannot be any public discourse of Strang's role in this province ostensibly designates him the despot of Nova Scotia. It is reprehensible what the media and the masses have made of this man -- and his critics! -- I just hope they will wear the shame of his consequences when they are exposed.

**UPDATE** -- The cancel culture mobsters and Dr. Strang's fragile ego ultimately got to Dr. Milburn and his position as [department head of emergency medicine for the Eastern zone](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/cape-breton-doctor-removed-as-head-of-emergency-medicine-for-eastern-zone-1.5473738). A truly sad and pathetic response to a common sense converstation about Strang's policies. Dr. Milburn's wife, Dr. Julie Curwin, [wrote a well-written op-ed](https://www.saltwire.com/cape-breton/opinion/local-perspectives/dr-julie-curwin-who-will-speak-for-covid-marginalized-patients-after-firing-of-sydney-er-chief-100602623/) raising more concerns over Dr. Despot's decisions. Now the that she stuck her head in the guilotine, it's only a matter of time before they get to her too.
