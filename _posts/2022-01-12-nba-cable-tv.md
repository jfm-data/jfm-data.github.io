I have a theory that the NBA’s popularity is much more closely tied with TV aspects than is considered by basketball media. I derive the theory from the wave TV viewership
over the last four decades and how watchable the non-game aspects as an entertainment product. The NBA’s rise in the 80s and 90s coincided with advancing video production
technology that made the game much more entertaining on TV. The introduction of sideline cameras, the sharpness of the players on the screen, and the slow-motion replay made
a much better canvas for the Jordan Bulls draw viewers than the more intriguing duels of Magic and Bird in the 80s.  The NBA during the 90’s Jordan era was a ratings juggernaut,
that the NBA hasn’t come close to reaching since.  You would think the improved live-action aesthetics of the more open game and advancement of media technology would improve
the quality of the product, but the decisions around TV production, the introduction of replay review, and rule abuse have soured viewing experience even from its hardcore fans.
The NBA has been fortunate to succeed despite its failures; ESPN and TNT have paid massive sums for the rights to broadcast the NBA, which subsequently exploded team
valuations across all markets. I wrote about the strong headwinds the NBA faces that should return the league to the economic reality of supply and demand. Before that
is forced upon them, the league has a chance to salvage their remaining years with its cable partners by improving the game as an entertainment product.

The fall of the viewing experience started when the NBA signed a deal with ABC/ESPN as its primary media partner. The Disney owned companies seem incapable of televising
the NBA’s premier games that would evoke intrigue and emotion like the way I remember the 90s NBC broadcasts. To anyone with big corporate experience, it is painfully
obvious that ABC/ESPN’s broadcasts are carefully overseen by an army of middle managers trying to control all aspects of its presentation. The micromanagement is most
apparent when watching its pre-game show, NBA Countdown, a soulless overproduced studio show desperate to come off as authentic.  The show is retooled every few years
but every incarnation is a vapid mess that suffers from their ignorance of the law of reverse effort. The harder ESPN tries to make it cool, the more plastic the show feels.
The executive’s primary retooling strategy is to treat the panel of talking heads like a slot machine of ex-jocks and pretty female faces. Periodically they pull the
lever trying to land on a combination that matches the Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson magic. No combo has ever come close, which should have the
executives considering how they produce the show the problem. If they run the show as loose as the TNT crew it might have a chance at being entertaining,
but it would still have to overcome the obstacles that inherently make pre-game shows meaningless in today’s saturated media environment. Given the number of failures,
the suits at ESPN seem committed sticking with this formula, so they might as well replace the “talent” with animatronic athletes programmed with the crowdsourced
talking points from the army of middle-managers. I seriously doubt anyone watching this garbage would notice the difference.

“The next ESPN/ABC fumble is the fast-food half-time show, brought to you by foreign car company, and presented by mega telco company. Here we are reunited
with the pre-game talking heads for 10 minutes of time killing analysis sandwiched between a barrage of corporate logos. “

So, after 30 minutes of corporate-approved prattle, you are not out of the woods yet – there is another 15 minutes of game hype and reports from the
on-location talking heads. This might be the most insufferable 15 minutes of television. It is like getting stuck in gridlock traffic a mile from your house. 
The NFL at least understands the public’s disdain for this bait and switch. Sunday afternoon games kick-off within a couple of minutes of the scheduled start time,
not a couple of commercial breaks.

The next ESPN/ABC fumble is the fast-food half-time show, brought to you by a foreign car company, and presented by mega telco company. Here we are reunited with th
e pre-game talking heads for 10 minutes of time killing analysis sandwiched between a barrage of corporate logos. We head into commercial with a deep voice telling
me to “Live Mas”. Well, I think it was an ad read, but it could have been a message from God since I just spent 10 minutes of life listening to Paul Pierce name 28 players to his top 5. After squeezing a few more commercial breaks we return to the commentators for some soft-edge chuckles so milquetoast I expect they are being fed by an associate producer.

The second half begins with the low-energy play that signals the players are content to put the game on cruise control. The energy shifts in the fourth, but not
before a head coach interview that has the game insights to make the pre-game show look like a graduate lecture on fluid dynamics. It is a scene where the coach 
is a contemptuous POW forced by his captor to perform in a propaganda piece. The recorded interview is aired during live-action play that follows the predictable
formula of sideline Barbie asking a hackneyed question and getting a checky or terse response. No one wants this train wreck, the involved parties included.  

You will know you’re at the end of a good game when you begin when you start seeming more State Farm commercials the field goal attempts. There are so many
breaks in the close games because coaches will use their absurd number of timeouts, or intentionally foul opponents, or worse, a play is reviewed. Was it a
block or a charge? Let’s take the next 5 minutes to analyze every camera angle like it’s the Zapruder film. What is truly odious is the degree of lobbying done
after each whistle. The mix of the player’s clout and the refs’ insecurities will determine if we waste 5 minutes. As for the review itself, if the call was
subjective then evidence must be overwhelming for the old crank to admit to a mistake he made. He is judge and jury on this own play call, so do not be surprised when
the call stands. We get 5 minutes of the commentators playing guessing the outcome of the review while not offending the ref’s call. It is a miserable 5-minutes and
you will be lucky to only hear it once. Replay review has become so entrenched in-game culture that when a ball goes out-of-bounds you would be paying plus-odds NOT
to see multiple players making the swirling gesture. I often think if NBA officials themselves are protesting the use of reviews by their parade to the review table for non-subjective calls. It’s a middle finger to the league for making the review their mistakes. The system is broken and needs to be independently run off-site or trashed.


If the game is within a possession, we might have the right conditions for the edge of your seat excitement. And if the game is sort of close, we are going to
see the abuse of rules by the trailing team in a cycle of an intentional foul, free throws, timeout, commercial, and shot. The cycle repeats until it gets close
enough or out of hand. I watched an NBA bubble game that took 14 minutes to play out the final 2 minutes of gameplay. Competitive games turning into a drawn-out
free throw contest is a major problem for the NBA. I was a bit too young, but I don’t remember hearing about this being used in the 90s when the NBA was a mainstream
product. Luckily for the NBA, they have an option. The Elam ending ensures a fair and meaningful finale that maintains the spirit of the game. It was a resounding 
success when implemented in the 2020 All-Star game and has helped the TBT gain relevance. Despite the near-universal praise, the NBA wouldn’t even commit to 
using the format next year’s exhibition game. This is total insanity when seen through the lens of any commercial business. If a company introduces a new and
improved feature that excites most of its customer base and is more attractive to new potential customers, then it will be deployed permanently. You would have 
to be a brain-dead company/CEO not to deploy it. I fail to understand the resistance from the league to even experiment with this format in the G-League, 
overtime games, and the summer league with a tentative timetable for major league adoption. Traditionalists who think watching an 8-point lead cut to 4,
and end at 6 points is “the way the game is meant to be played, DAMMIT!” have such a warped view on reality it’s a waste of time to even address them.
Basketball’s rules are not immutable. Every year there are tweaks to the rules and in 1979, the 3-point line was introduced. The change was first adopted 
on a one-year trial and was unexpectedly panned by the narrow-minded traditionalists of the 80s as a gimmick. I view the Elam ending less radical than the
3-point line as its intent is to save the integrity of the game rather than change on-court dynamics. The adoption of the Elam ending a no-brainer solution.

 

It is clear the NBA faces a fiscal cliff that comes from the predictable demise of its Golden goose. They do have options to better positioned for when the
inevitable paradigm change is forced upon them. Given the rate of TV rating decline, rule changes and how the game is packaged need immediate consideration.
Sadly, the NBA confuses their monopoly on professional basketball as a license to act as an irrigation business. The reality is the league is not competing
in the basketball or sports business, they are competing in the entertainment universe where they are fading star. The NBA needs to make proactive to increase
its entertainment value or fall faster into irrelevancy like baseball and hockey, but I am not holding my breath.
