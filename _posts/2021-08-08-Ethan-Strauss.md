TL:DR -- FS1 IMHO, jump below to see reasons why

In mid-July I noticed Ethan Strauss stopped publishing articles at The Athletic. I missed his writing, not only
were business side of basketball columns interesting, but he's also an uber talented writer. 
I became a fan after his 2016 exposÃ© on [how Nike had lost Steph Curry to UA](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour). It was an original perspective of how the NBA had become a battleground for a proxy war
happening between Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. The article framed how the sneaker companies relationships with the top 1% of players were more important than their NBA team. Given the obvious financial incentives, Ethan raised the provocative question: who are they really working for? It was something to ponder and may inform why some player movement is hapeening in the NBA....which led into his next massive story.

On Ethan's unceremonious exit from ESPN in 2017, the WWL [published his must-read article on how Durant signing with the Warriors](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19256296/golden-state-warriors-steph-curry-stopped-only-kevin-durant) was a UA nightmare come reality.
At that time, Steph Curry was the undisputed most popular player in the NBA with a surprisingly popular signature shoe. His team and individual success generated much envy from the other marquee names,
particularly LeBron James who crowned himself as King and represented Nike. Steph's popularity made his shoe one of the best sellers and turned UA into a real competitor in teh sneaker market. KD's signing with the Warriors took the wind out of the sails for UA and Curry's national reputation. The Warriors were still popular, 
but adding the best player in the league to a 73-win team brought public resentment and lost them the title of everyone's second favourite. 
And with Steph no longer the offensive fulcrum of a fun-to-watch organically built team, his popularity also waned. Nike was greatful for it. In KD's first year, Under Armour lost ~50% /$10B of its market value. Coincidently, it stayed low until Steph was back in carrying the GSW offense. It was a great 
article that added more credibility to his reporting and insights to the game behind the game.

After his ESPN contract ended, Ethan joined The Athletic as a columnist writing about the NBA, the Warriors, gambling, and the business side of basketball.
More recently, Strauss has become infamous in NBA fandom for shining a spotlight on the NBA's sagging TV ratings. He wrote elegantly and objectively
on the viewership while competing with the league's PR and the irate social media trolls. I really enjoyed these articles. I had studied the pay-TV market in 2015
when looking at the media venture capital fund that held a portfolio of content sold to cable specialty channels. I knew where the market was heading and was always annoyed 
to hear the overused trope that the next broadcast rights deal would be massive. It defied the economics and media trends. Strauss was the first major reporter (to my knowledge) to openly discuss and challenge that narrative. His reporting made him a lightning rod of criticism for those who saw it defaming the NBA and the politics it embraced.
Ethan had simply identified some of the independent variables for the decline without getting into the righteousness of the politics themselves. Regardless,
this angered a contingent of "woke" fans for even suggesting it. I guess for them, to be ignorant of the failing ratings is a thing of virtue.  

It was waild to see the amount of vitriol Ethan got for his reporting on TV ratings. The phenomenon exemplifies how anything can be is interally
politicalized. There is no obvious political agenda in Ethan's reporting. He is calling balls and strikes as it came to NBA's PR spin on falling viewership. Despite his Cal Berkely education and decision to live in the area, most people on Twitter react to his columns like he's a MAGA pizza-gater.

So where is Strauss going? Tom Haberstroh had insinuated that he would be covering the NBA from a national perspective. We could safely rule 
out ESPN and TNT/Blecher Report. I am sure the two league broadcast partners would try to deplatform him before trying to hire him. Perhaps a national newspaper --Marc Stein is leaving with NYT in a full-time role. Ethan has the talent to write for the Times, but given his recent foucs on the business-side, the WSJ would be a much better fit. He could also write a Substack and earn directly from his patrons. He would tease that his articles on ratings were very
popular, so perhaps he has a big enough audience where he would earn more writing for himself on Substack.

But where I think he'll go is FS1. Strauss has always been a favorite of Colin Cowherd. Cowherd appreciates Ethan's thinking and would find ways to
include him in other parts of his 2-hour daily show. Since FS1 is not a league partner, he would be free and encouraged to write about ratings without repercussions. Plus, Colin's importantace with the company might mean he would have to authority to offer Ethan a big salary increase from The Athletic.


### EDIT:

Quick update: I have to be more specific with my prediciton -- it might be Cowherd's podcast company, *The Volume Sports* as I saw this on my timeline...

Also, there is a chance he joins Dan Le Batard's company given his amusing resposne...unless he did this purely to take the piss out of Colin. Since both are promising big announcements in the next couple weeks, I suspect one of them will be about Strauss.
