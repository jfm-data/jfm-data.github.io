Apologies to the religious folk insulted by my characterization that Bitcoin is a religion -- I understand why you wouldn't
want to be associated with a bunch of zealots who strongly believe in an abstract story with poorly documented origins. However, the similarities are just too hard to ignore. 
You have the sacred text (the Satoshi white paper), the idolatry (BTC/USD), hierograms (â‚¿), sacraments (laser eyes on avi; diamond hands), 
the parables (the betrayal of ~~Judas~~ Elon), holy days of observance (Bitcoin Pizza Day) and perhaps most importantly, the preaching clergy spreading the gospel (Saylor, Pomp, Wood). These high priests evangelize to the unconverted how a devout commitment to Bitcoin is the only true salvation from the evils of "The Fed".  
They are the torchbearers who shed light on how a asserted digital gold is superior to real gold (or anyother store of value) due to its ~~artificial~~ divine scarcity.  

To join the ~~cult~~ religion is not as simple as buying BTC on Coinbase. One must follow the strict dogma to be considered a member of the faith.
The first rule is to recognize and accept Bitcoin as a monotheistic religion.
The communion's strength relies on followers having an undivided crypto wallet. Any dalliance with 'shitcoins' is flagrant heresy.  

Secondly, you may only buy BTC and must __NEVER__ sell BTC. Never selling is a very sacred principle that when practiced, ascends your spiritual and physical being to a "HODLer" state. 
Even on your financial death bed, one must abide by the solemn act of HODLing, as helping restrict the supply of BTC is the most righteous offering a follower can make to the BTC/USD God.  

Thirdly, the religion does involve theology. A HODLer must be well-versed in all the main talking points:
-  BTC is a revolutionary one-of-a-kind technology (_only used when counterparty knows absolutely nothing about crypto or technology_) 
- ~~It's a digital currency for peer-to-peer transactions~~ (_err, it's been 12 years and still no one uses it as currency, so maybe not_)  
- It's a store of value that is protected from the FED's inflation! (_just don't show them any chart or r2-value that reveals zero relationship between inflation and BTC price_)
- It can't be manipulated! (_this talking point becomes temporary invalid when a "dip" happens and we need to scapegoat a Whale selling). 
- It's the Apex predator of the financial markets (_just like MySpace is the apex predator of social networks_).
You must also study the language of HODLers. HFSP, FUD, BTFD, REKT, Rug pull, are necessary terms to understand. They help identify other members of the faith on ~~echo chambers~~ meassageboards, and are very useful when it's time to ratchet up the FOMO on the pagans. These terms also also handy when thrash pagans who are tempted by shitcoins.

Finally, since the BTC/USD God requires new members for it to grow stronger, there is an ordinance of evangelism. Twitter is preferred mediumn for missionary work, 
so please please adorn your profile with hierograms such as "#Bitcoin" in your bio and adding glowing red lights over your avatar's eyes.
More devout members will amplify the creeds of our holy men by re-tweeting their irreconcilable truths.  In moments of FUD, look to tweet/retweet messages like 
"_I'M NEVER SELLING!!_" or "_I just bought the dip, did you?_". While during moments of "When Lambo?" add fuel to mania-fire by tweeting: 
"_Imagine what the price next year!!_" and the classic "ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€".
