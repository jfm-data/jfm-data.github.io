Hello, welcome to my personal blog -- version 2.0. I am migrating my thoughts from a personal website that I am leaving derelict. The frustration from using WordPress and my dissatisfaction with BlueHost had left me unmotivated to post with any type of regularity. It seemed there was a 1:1 ratio between time spent writing and backend configuration to publish it properly. It didn't seem worth it. But now that I am using my GitHub pages, I can write a post in a markdown file with little admin time while still having control. The ease and freedom has renewed my interest in blogging.

I am going to post as much as possible. My current commitment is to spend an hour a day writing. I find it helps improve my clarity of thinking and it will surely strengthen some skills I was told I lacked. I will write on anything that grabs my interest... including politcs. I am a data-driven critical-thinker that does not acquiesce to trendy narratives, so most potential employers might not like what I have to say when I wade into those waters. You can call this professional Darwinism, but I want to be authentic for those who might actually enjoy it. Eitehr way, get in touch if you love it or hate it.

JM
