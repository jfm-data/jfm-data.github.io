NBA TV Ratings are not a virtue.

Adam Silver is a peacetime president who is no longer effective as the stewarding the league. His reluctance to make any decisions that would warrant even mild criticisms from the players union has created consequences that the league will struggle to overcome while it deals with failing ratings.

Currently, Silver's reputation continues to gorge on his decision to force an infirm Donald Sterling to sell the Clippers for a record two billion dollars. I found that Silver being cast as a hero for getting the reviled Donland Sterling a $2B return on his $20M investment completely absurd.
