After many years of contemplating and 50+ unsatisfying hours learning HTML and web design, I launched a personal website.
Despite my previous investment, I always failed at finding the rationale; I had nothing to sell and writing seemed like more of a liability than an asset.
It wasn't until I found David Perell's Twitter feed that changed my mind.  If you are unfamiliar, David is known as "The Writing Guy" on Twitter,
a moniker he earned from sharing wisdom on the power of writing(@david_perell --go follow him now). One of his bits of wisdom is how the personal 
website becoming the new resume. For my new stage in life, it was worth trusting him. I needed a space to share my data science projects and control their presentation.
By distilling the projects in writing would convert what would be a Kaggle submission or Github repo into a shareable asset.
