I am a little reluctant to call the Bitcoin community a religion because it seems unfair and insulting to most organized religions. 
But the hallmarks are there. You have the idolatry (Bitcoin BTC/USD), the sacred text (the Satoshi white paper), hierograms (laser eyes on avi; diamond hands),
the mythologies (the betrayal of ~~Judas~~ Elon), holy days of observance (Bitcoin Pizza Day) and perhaps most importantly, the clergy spreading the gospel (Saylor, Pomp, Wood, just to name a few).
These high priests evangelize to the unconverted how a devout commitment to Bitcoin is the only true salvation from the evils of "The Fed".  
They are the torchbearers that it's digital gold that is superior to real gold because of its ~~artificial~~ divine scarcity.  

To join the ~~cult~~ religion is not as simple as buying BTC on Coinbase. You must follow the strict dogma to be considered a member of the faith.
The first rule is to recognize and accept Bitcoin as a monotheistic religion.
The communion's strength relies on followers having an undivided crypto wallet. Any dalliance with 'shitcoins' is flagrant heresy.  

Secondly, you may only buy BTC and must __NEVER__ sell BTC. Never selling is a very sacred principle that when practiced, ascends your spiritual being to a "HODLer" state. 
Even on your financial death bed, one must abide by the solemn act of HODLing. 
As helping restrict the supply of BTC is the most righteous offering a follower can make to the BTC/USD God.  

Thirdly, there is some required theology involved in being a HODLer.  One must be well-versed in all the main talking points:
-  BTC is a revolutionary one-of-a-kind technology (only used when counterparty know absolutely nothing about crypto ) 
- ~~It's a digital currency for peer-to-peer transactions~~ (err, it's been 12 years and still no one uses it as currency, so maybe not)  
- It's a store of value that is protected from the FED's inflation (just don't show them the price of BTC with inflation as the r2=0.01
-"It can't be manipulated!" (this talking point becomes temporary invalid when a "dip" happens and need to scapegoat a Whale). 
- It's the Apex predator of the financial markets (just like MySpace is the apex predator of social networks).
You must also study the language. HFSP, FUD, BTFD, REKT, Rug pull, are just some terms needed to ratchet up the FOMO on the pagans.

Finally, the path to HODLer status requires evangelism through social media mediums. The preferred social network is Twitter, 
so please please adorn your profile with hierograms such as #Bitcoin in your bio and adding glowing red lights over your avatar's eyes.
More devout members will amplify the creeds of holy men by re-tweeting their irreconcilable truths.  So in moments of FUD, look to retweet messages like 
"_I'M NEVER SELLING!!_" or "_I just bought the dip, did you?_". While in during moments of "When Lambo?" add fuel to mania-fire by retweeting: 
"_Imagine what the price next year!_" and the classic "ROCKET EMOJI".
