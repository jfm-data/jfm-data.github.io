I am a multi-time statistic of the Canadian inter-provincial migration. I’ve lived on the Pacific and the Atlantic coasts,
on the Upper and Lower Canada dividing line, and the country’s only true metropolis, Toronto. At all my stops,
I met and befriended many like myself: Canadians who’ve crossed provincial lines to pursue career opportunities not available at home.
Trying to understand the flows of domestic migration, I lookup up the data available from the Statistics Canada website. Judging from my own experience,
I had assumed that there would be a few provinces with net increases (Ontario, BC, and Alberta) with the rest bleeding citizens.
I compiled the data spanning 11 years — from the time I left NS in July 2007, to June 2018, the last data available on StatsCan.
I transformed the data to create a chord diagram showing the movements from province-to-province as well as diverging bar charts to show the total 
and the relative net changes for the period. I will post the R code on my GitHub page and update the code and numbers in 6 months time when we have estimates on the change during 
COVID. Judging by how ridiculous the local market is right now, I suspect we'll see more coming into the province.
