With the Omicron variant causing COVID cases to surge almost everywhere, there is a lot of open talk on how society may, or perhaps should, start living with COVID rather than with the promoting fear and more interventionist restrictions. Yet, with every open question there is a familiar refrain *"but, I am not a doctor"*. It is irritating to hear that the barrier of being an MD has become such a convenient way to censor any constructive conversation.


But I am writing to say it past time we end this nonsense on COVID policy discussion. If someone were to publicly suggest something the veers one degree off the narrative like Bill Simmons did this week, they will undermine their own valid observations with the declaration of not being an expert. It is disturbing to exclusively allow people who went through gatekeepers to be considered qualified to speak on issues. It is such a bad idea that it is something both Karl Marx and Adam Smith can agree on. **Limiting thoughts to only certain people is not only a classist and monopolist behaviour, but it is a form of artificial restriction to a means of production**.


If someone has the intelligence and capacity to understand and analyze a problem, it is foolish to preemptively censor them on a perceived lack of credentials. A person should be granted the freedom to make a cogent argument in good faith to the public. And if they are wrong, then it should be easy to refute by the documented experts and non-experts alike -- which thereby adds credibility to prevailing narrative. This type of challenge is *a fundamental aspect* of science, knowledge, and learning. 


What might be more concerning is the selective acceptance of credentialism. Since credentials can often be determined in shades of grey, people's biases will find a way to discredit anyone they disagree with regardless of status. Just locally, the top "Top Doctor" for Nova Scotia's northern region, faced credential doubt when he shared taboo thoughts on COVID policy on CBC radio last summer.  The non-doctors of social media went crazy to disprove him as just an "ER doctor" not qualified to offer his thoughts on school closures and vaccine passports. Even researchers with impeccable credentials as Yale Professor Dr. Harvey Risch (the most cited epidemiologist in the US) or Standford Professor Dr. Jay Bhattacharya have been ignored and denied a voice on mainstream media to discuss COVID. So, we can only listen to doctors, but only the ones who say the **right** things.



Even questioning the right experts is not acceptable in polite society. There are countless examples, but I use how Aaron Rodgers, who was formerly considered a "smart guy", got raked over the coals for his one infamous appearance on the Pat McAfee Show. In challenging the NFL's COVID protocols and how the media has covered his vaccination status, Aaron's reputation took an irrevocable beating. The common response were ad hominem attacks with the insult de jour being "anti-vaxxer".  Those a little more discerning slammed his weakest points, but almost no one gave him recognition for his arguments that couldn't be easily assuaged. He was making a point I think all of us can agree with. When I go to a pub I show my vaccine card, and I need to wear my mask while I walk to my seat by not when I am sitting down. 

Even a generational geniuslike Elon Musk is not immune from speakingly openly about COVID policy -- and has often been accused of spreading misinformation. Elon is a brilliant autodidact who has built enormously complex and successful companies in competitive industries. Yet, he gets whacked with the blunt instrument of credentialism. YES, he may be  sending people to Mars and have created several planet-changing companies, by apparently not smart enough to have an informed opinion on COVID policy.


Meanwhile, one of the most predominant voices of the COVID-19 pandemic is Bill Gates. The lack of a medical degree from the Mircosoft founder has not been a point of interest for the journalists who are eager to *platform* him.

But of course, this same restraint wasn't present when he told millions of listeners that getting vaccinated would prevent infection 6-months ago.


It is well overdue that people let their guards down when it comes to speaking on COVID. We are two years in and the surest way to avoid the lockdown here is for public opinion to not accept one. This is what happened elsewhere, and now it needs to happen here. Please speak freely.
