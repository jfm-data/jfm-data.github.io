I recently dealt with a health scare -- not me, but my 2.5-year-old Aussie Mountain Doodle, Hunter. He's not out of the woods yet, but there was a point where 
I thought I was going to lose him. The situation made me reflect on dog ownership and my connection with him.

**A little about him:**
Hunter is 85 lbs of fur and fury. He is most alive when I take him to the dog park -- a place he was once bullied but now treats as his realm. 
  He's immediately absorbed by larger dogs there and is eager to perform alpha tests. He'll sniff and follow them around making sure he pees over any of their markings. 
  And if the dog seems like a worthy challenger, he'll go for a mounting (Hunter is fixed). Many will result in a wrestling match. I have never worried about him during a scuffle, while he looks like a big teddy bear, but I've seen him pin larger German Shepherds and Rottweilers. Even when if the aggression goes up levels I feel confident in his restraint and ability to defend himself.

He's quite a character outside of the prison yard dog park. He's extremely food dominant and trusting of strangers. He will go up to anyone who he thinks may have food 
  and act like he's their best friend. He also loves children. His breeders had three daughters who raised him from the womb which has left a lasting impression on him.
  Whenever he sees kids he is whining and pulling to see them (though most of the children run away when a 'giant' dog is keen on getting to them -- much like my very precious niece who is terrified).
  
I have grown up with a Bichon Friese and a Golden Retriever, and one characteristic that stands out is Hunter's intelligence. Not only was easy to train, but he's a
  problem solver. Just a few weeks ago he demonstrated his skill while playing fetch over an icy snow-covered field. After taking a direct line for the ball, he looked back at me and ran west to a crescent beaten-down path. Despite it being a much longer distance he quickly realized it was more optimal than the A -> B path. 

Of course, there is a flip side of his canny. It's hard to sneak out or have a bite without his notice. I am always amazed at how well he anticipates my actions.
  Before I even have a jacket on he'll be sitting in front of the door with a melancholy look of abandonment.

My relationship with him is special. He's not my "fur baby" nor am I his "father", but I am his best buddy. Dogs are the most unselfish friends that a man can
  have in this selfish world. He never proves ungrateful or treacherous, and his most elated when I return home. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, his affection is as constant as the moon orbiting the earth.

I am grateful for his presence in my life and I will do what's necessary to keep him happy and healthy.
