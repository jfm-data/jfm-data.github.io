In mid-July I noticed I haven't read Ethan Strauss in a while, so I had to check if I had missed one of his published articles. 
I love reading about the business side of basketball, and not only does Ethan cover it from interesting angles, but he's also an immensely talented writer. 
I became a fan after his 2016 expose on [how Nike had lost Steph Curry to UA](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/15047018/how-nike-lost-stephen-curry-armour). It was an original perspective of how the NBA is the battleground for a proxy war
between giant athletic apparel companies. The article framed that for the top 1% of players, their relationships with these companies are stronger, longer-lasting,
and more financially lucrative than what any NBA franchise could offer them. Which raises the question, who do are they really working for? I might have thought it
was a little sensationalized while thinking something akin to what Kevin Durrant said later in 2016: "ain't no one wears those", except the next time I was getting
up shots at the Y, I noticed everyone under 20 was wearing Curry's signature shoes. 

Upon his unceremonious exit from ESPN in 2017, the WWL [published his last must-read on how Durant signing with the Warriors](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/presents19256296/golden-state-warriors-steph-curry-stopped-only-kevin-durant) was a UA fever dream come reality.
At that time, Steph Curry was the undisputed most popular player in the NBA. His team and individual success generated much envy from the other marquee names,
particularly LeBron James who held the mantle. I remember even Obama's doing a viral video sketch
with Steph and his wife, raising accusations of the Obama's were clout chasing. Steph was an incandescent star. 
KD's signing with the Warriors took the wind out of the sails for UA and Curry's national reputation. The Warriors were still popular, 
but adding the best player in the league to a 73-win team brought public resentment and lost them the title of everyone's second favourite team. 
And with Steph no longer the offensive fulcrum of a fun-to-watch organically built team, his popularity waned.  In the first year that Durant played 
with the Warriors, Under Armor lost  ~50% /$10B of its market value and coincidently stayed low until Steph was back in carrying the GSW. It was a great 
article that added more credibility to his reporting.

After his ESPN contract ended, Ethan joined The Athletic as a columnist writing about the NBA, the Warriors, gambling, and the business side of basketball.
For the past year, Strauss has become known and infamous in NBA fandom for shining a spotlight on the NBA's dull TV ratings. He wrote elegantly and objectively
on the viewership while competing with the league's PR spin and the irate social media trolls. I really enjoyed them. I had studied the pay-TV market in 2015
when looking at the media venture capital fund that held a portfolio of cable specialty channels. I knew where the market was heading and was always annoyed 
to hear the lazy NBA narrative that the next broadcast rights deal would be massive. Strauss was the first reporter (to my knowledge) to openly discuss the
fall and challenged the narrative. His reporting made him a lightning rod of criticism for those who saw it defaming the NBA and the politics it embraced.
Ethan had simply identified some of the independent variables for the decline, without getting into the righteousness of the politics themselves. Regardless,
this angered a contingent of left-leaning and media fans for even suggesting it. For them, to be ignorant of the failing ratings is a thing of virtue.  

To me, it's crazy the amount of vitriol Ethan gets for his reporting on TV ratings. The phenomenon might demonstrate how everything interally
politicalized and there is no such thing as rational arguments. There is no political agenda in Ethan's reporting. He calls balls and strikes.
Yet, if you search Ethan's name on Twitter (like I did to see where he's going) all you get are randoms hating on him for his ratings articles.

So where is Strauss going? Tom Haberstroh had insinuated that he would be covering the NBA from a national perspective. We could probably rule 
out ESPN and TNT/Blecher Report. I am sure the two league broadcast partners would be reluctant to hire someone who generated negative press about 
their product. Perhaps a national newspaper. Marc Stein is leaving with NYT in a full-time role. Ethan has the talent to write for the TImes, he would
be a much better fit with the WSJ. He could also write a Substack and earn directly from his patrons. He would tease that his articles on ratings were very
popular, perhaps he has a big enough audience where he would earn writing for himself.

But where I think he'll go is Fox Sports. Strauss has always been a favourite of Colin Cowherd.  Cowherd appreciates Ethan's thinking and would find ways to
include him in other parts of his show. Since Fox Sports is not a league partner, he would be free and encouraged to write about ratings without repercussions. 
Wherever he goes, I will be reading and listening.
