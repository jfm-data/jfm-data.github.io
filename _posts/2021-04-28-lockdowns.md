The Nova Scotia government made puzzling and frustrating news when they decided to lockdown for the third time. The initial stay-at-home order was unprecedentedly made under caution that the virus' infection fatality rate was 2%, which might have been a prudent move at the time with so much unknown. Except today, politicians have the benefit of acting on the knowledge and lessons from analyzing 14-months of emiprical data. The decision for Rankin and Strang to ignore the data in favor of a destructive policy made only made in brief moment of global anxious uncertainty reveals a cowardice and incompetence that should be met with public contempt.

Confused? well, despite the hymns of "trust the science" being harmonized over lockdown edicts along with the media lauding them as a saving grace (geez, I wonder why they would want us to stay home all day?), the science of lockdowns never existed and their unintended consequences poorly considered and communicated. The mounting evidence since March 2020 demostrates at best they only temporarily contained the spread of COVID-19 while generating a host of new problems. Take the following chart that splits the relative number of COVID deaths in European countries during the first and second waves. The asymmetry of the chart is striking and the media headlines praising the success of first-wave lockdowns premature and embarrassing. These lockdowns didn't prevent these deaths, only delayed them at a much greater societal expense that will linger for months and years beyond these 'temporary' dates.

The NS government should have also focused on evaluating the success and failures of jurisdictions that opted out of the second wave lockdowns and those that locked down harder. Florida, whose Governor had the temerity to seek the counsel of renowned scientists *NOT* employed by the Government (how dare he seek medical advice from Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford tenured MD researchers?), decided to remove all COVID related-restrictions including mask mandates in September 2020. In contrast, California enforced strict and extended lockdown measures that prohibited outdoor dining and mandated outdoor mask-wearing. The public got to witness a ~6 month trial in the 'Florida vs. California' policy experiment. Given weather and population similarities, this was as close to a perfectly designed A/B test we could have hoped. And well, the data speaks for itself (see below). The seemingly counterintuitive results had new Floridians happy and emboldened other policy-makers in March 2021 to follow Florida's lead. Undeterred by the favourable outcomes, the lockdown issue ostensibly became a political one. When Texas announced a course correction it came under a hail of criticism from a cowardly left-leaning political class. Newsom called it "reckless" and Biden said it was "Neatherthal thinking". Since Abbot's announcement in early March, Texas' metrics continue to decline despite its return to normalcy that included soldout baseball stadiums. When they forecasted impending doom for the policy failed to materialize, [a bewildered Dr. Fauci was completely lost](https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/fauci-not-sure-why-texas-doesnt-have-covid-uptick-after-nixing-masks/) when questioned.

So let's jump to the problems they are creating: so far I have seen at least a dozen local businesses shutter under these lockdowns (and there are likely hundreds on the brink of financial ruin). These are businesses that took a lifetime to build and provide livelihoods to thousands of Nova Scotians. "JuSt bAil ThEm OuT!" is not a viable short or long-term solution. Doing so is just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic as it is a de facto taxpayer-funded subsidy to the large corporations (like Amazon, Walmart, Costco) that are permitted to serve the public's needs. Not to mention that these lockdowns are creating a widening economic disparity between the working class and the white-collar professionals working from home. Those WFH'ing are not only saving thousands but they are growing their windfalls through real estate, equities, and crypto market investments (all of which are ripping). The lockdown class in Canada loves this and are cheerleading these destructive policies while believing "we are in this together". Meanwhile, these lockdowns are financially crippling workers in the service and hospitality industries which will remain wounded and playing catch-up for years.  

The lockdowns are also creating a mental health crisis. This is not limited to those affected by the economic ramifications, but those depressed from forced social isolation. This poorly covered crisis was worth mention in a recent quarterly report from Stats Canada that tried to contextualize the excess mortality in Canada not directly related to the COVID-19 virus (source: [StatsCan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/210310/dq210310c-eng.pdf?st=fHDKnpD3)). Tragically, during the fall lockdowns, they observed a 24% increase in deaths of males under 45, while only a 6% increase in the COVID vulnerable over 85 demographic. They had no direct answers but considered it as a consequence of lockdowns. And in February 2021, [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00175-z) published a study that found depression and anxiety in the UK increased by a factor of four during 2020. Why are these Health leaders not taking a holistic approach to public health? I mean, shutting down gyms, yoga studios, and fitness centres is exacerbating a health crisis, rather than helping us avoid one.

I am sure this is only the tip of the iceberg for the sins of the lockdowns. I am confident that years from now we'll hear about the brutal and widespread domestic abuse as well as the child abuse that took place during this time. They will be covered by the media and sorrow without any reprimand for the deified bureaucrats and politicians that are culpable for the victim's circumstances. To the politicians & bureaucrats, "managing numbers" to placate the fear-soaked simple minds has become priority number one and a form of self-preservation. Their abject failure to evaluate the observational and experimental data to assess the risks and costs of their decisions makes them feckless and incompetent rubes. Sadly, they will likely be rewarded more terms and accolades before they get their comeuppance. I just hope it comes sooner rather than later.
