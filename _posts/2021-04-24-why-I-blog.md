Hello, welcome to my personal blog -- version 2.0. I am migrating my thoughts from a personal website that I am leaving derelict to here. The frustration of using WordPress and my dissatisfaction with BlueHost had left me unmotivated to post with any type of regularity. It seemed there was a 1:1 ratio between writing time and backend configuration to publish it properly. It wasn't worth it. But now that I am using my GitHub pages, I can write a post in a markdown file with little website admin time while still having a lot of control. The ease and freedom has renewed my interest.

I am going to post as much as possible. My current commitment is to spend an hour a day writing. I find it helps improve my clarity of thinking and it will surely strengthen some skills I was told I lacked. I will write about a wide range of topics -- really anything that grabs my interest. I will touch on political issues at my personal peril. I am a data-driven critical-thinker that does not acquiesce to trendy narratives, so most potential employers might not like what I have to say when I wade into those waters. You call this potential professional Darwinism, but I want to be authentic for those who might actually enjoy it. If you have an issue with the things I write, please get in touch as I am reachable.

JM
