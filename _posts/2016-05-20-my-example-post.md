To be transparent, I donâ€™t own any Bitcoin, I've never owned any, and I am way past the point of ever consider buying Bitcoin. Neither am I an expert in crypto/blockchain technology, so feel free to label me a Bitcoin hater that doesn't "get it". But if that is your attitude, you are likely a willing party to the Bitcoin Ponzi scheme.
I first paid attention to Bitcoin when it was priced around $100 in 2013. Looking back on it, I have huge regrets about not buying a few coins, but my initial assessment of its value proposition has only gotten more negative. By 2021, its staggering price, the endless superior competition, and the narrow scope of utility should make it a worthless asset for new speculators. However, Bitcoin-mania persists and is stronger than ever. So what's going on?
