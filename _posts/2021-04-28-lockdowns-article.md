Last week Nova Scotia's provincial government announced severe lockdown measures for the municipality of Halifax, which followed a province-wide lockdown announcement made yesterday. This was shocking and frustrating news. With fourteen months since the initial stay-at-home order, the politicians should be making decisions with the benefit of hindsight and data. Despite them being lauded by the media (I wonder why they would want us to stay home all day?) as life-saving, there is weak evidence to support lockdowns as an effective public health solution. We have learned from past surges that lockdowns are at best, only temporarily delay the spread of COVID-19, while creating a whole host of new problems that will linger for months or years beyond these 'temporary' dates.  Take the following chart that shows the relative number of COVID deaths in European countries during the first and second waves. The asymmetry of the chart is striking; and the media headlines praising the success of first-wave lockdowns, premature and embarrassing.

Today's government should benefit from evaluating the success and failures of places that opted out of the second wave lockdowns, and those who locked-down harder. Florida, whose Governor had the temerity to seek the counsel of renowned scientists not employed by the Government (how dare he seek medical advice from Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford tenured MD researchers?), decided to remove all COVID related-restrictions including a state-level ban of mask mandates. In contrast, California had strict and extended lockdown measures that included prohibiting outdoor dining and outdoor mask-wearing. After months of data was gathered on Florida's vs. California's approaches, the data speaks for itself (see below).  Florida's success emboldened other leaders to follow their lead in re-opening. When the second-largest state Texas announced it was re-opening fully it came under a hail of criticism from a cowardly political class. Newsom called it "reckless" and Biden said it was "Neatherthal thinking". Since early March, Texas' metrics continue to decline despite returning to normalcy and full capacity baseball games. Texas even has Fauci, a critic of the policy, bewildered by the downward trends.

So let's jump to the problems they are creating: So far I have seen at least a dozen local businesses shutter related to these lockdowns, and I am sure there are hundreds on the brink of financial ruin. These are businesses that took a lifetime to build and provide livelihoods to thousands of Nova Scotias. "JuSt bAil ThEm OuT!" is not a viable short or long-term solution. Doing so is just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic as it's effectively a taxpayer-funded subsidy to the large corporations(like Amazon, Walmart, Costco) that are allowed to serve the public needs. Not to mention that these lockdowns are creating a widening economic disparity between the working class and the white-collar professionals working from home. Those WFH'ing are not only saving thousands but they are growing their windfalls through real estate, equities, and crypto markets investments (all of which are ripping). Meanwhile, these policies are financially crippling workers in the service and hospitality industries which will remain wounded for years.

The lockdowns are also creating a mental health crisis. This is not limited to those affected by economic ramifications but those depressed from forced social isolation. This undercovered crisis was eluded to in a recent quarterly report from Stats Canada that tried to contextualize the excess mortality in Canada that could not be directly contributed to COVID-19 [StatsCan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/210310/dq210310c-eng.pdf?st=fHDKnpD3). Tragically they observed a 24% increase in deaths of males under 45, while only a 6% increase in the COVID vulnerable 85+ demographic. And in February 2021, Nature published a study that found depression and anxiety in the UK increased by a factor of 4 in 2020 - [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00175-z). I am not sure why there is not a holistic approach to public health? I mean, shutting down gyms, yoga studios, and fitness centres is exacerbating a health crisis, rather than helping us avoid one.

I am sure this is only the tip of the iceberg for the sins of the lockdowns. I am confident that years from now we'll hear about the brutal and widespread domestic abuse and child abuse that took place. They will be covered by the media and sorrow without any acknowledgment for the deified bureaucrats and politicians that are culpable for their circumstances. To them, "managing numbers" to placate the fear-soaked simple minds has become priority number one and a form of self-preservation. To me, they are feckless and incompetent. Their abject failure to assess the risks and costs of their decisions is appalling. Sadly, they will likely be rewarded more terms and accolades before they get their comeuppance.
