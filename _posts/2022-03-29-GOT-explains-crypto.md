With the disappointing last 4-seasons of HBO's Game of Thrones a suppressed and distant memory, I have begun re-reading the series with untainted pleasure. Not only are the world-building and character developments incredible, but throughout the rich text, there is philosophy and wisdom that stews in my mind for days after reading. The one gnawing on my thoughts right now is the riddle that Varys posed to Tyrion in <i>A Clash of Kings</i>.

<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px;"> “In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword,
a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two.<br> <i>‘Do it,’ 
says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’<br> ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ 
<br>‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’</i> <b><br>So tell me – who lives and who dies?”</b></p>

Varys riddle is masking the real question of "what is power?" and who truly wields it? While I could dive deeper into the greater societal significance of such questions (and will in a future post), we can apply the same thought exercise can be to the crowded crypto market as it comes to ~~power~~ value. 

With the increasing velocity at which new advanced blockchains are being developed, what makes a legacy crypto token like Bitcoin the most valuable? From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is inefficient, costly, less secure, and less practical than the 20,000 thousand more advanced blockchains that used it as the development blueprint. 

So why do their holders claim it's the future of money or gold? Why do people believe that one token of intangible outdated software is worth $46,000 now with the expectation of it being priced at $100K... or even a million dollars?


<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px;">  “Power is a curious thing, my lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?”


“It has crossed my mind a time or two,” Tyrion admitted. “The king, the priest, the rich man—who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It’s a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many answers. All depends on the man with the sword.”


“And yet he is no one,” Varys said. “He has neither crown nor gold nor favour of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.”
“That piece of steel is the power of life and death.”
“Just so… yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father?”


“Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.”


“Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they?” Varys smiled. “Some say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the gods. Others say it derives from law."


Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my headache worse?”
Varys smiled. “Here, then. **Power resides where men believe it resides**. No more and no less.”
“So power is a mummer’s trick?”

**“A shadow on the wall,”** Varys murmured, **“yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”**</blockquote>
