To be transparent, I donâ€™t own any Bitcoin, I've never owned any Bitcoin, and I am way past the point of ever consider buying Bitcoin. Neither am I an expert in crypto/blockchain technology, so feel free to label me a Bitcoin hater that doesn't "get it". But if that is your attitude, have an open mind while reading.

I first heard of Bitcoin when Silk Road was shut down in March 2013 and the attention valuted its price from $30 to $100. I couldn't wrap my mind around paying $100 for something with no intrinsic value.  Looking back on it, I have huge regrets about not buying a few tokens on speculation, but my initial assessment of its value proposition has only gotten more negative. In 2021, its staggering price, the endless superior competition, and the narrow scope of utility should make it a worthless asset for new speculators. However, Bitcoin-mania persists and is stronger than ever. So what's going on?

I believe the majority of credit of Bitcoin's "value" is owed to a fervent evangelist community that espouses Bitcoin's virtues --most of which are falsehoods that purposefully conflate the novel utility of advanced cryptos with the ground-breaking original. They have been successful in pushing these lies on the stupid and willingly ignorant who succumb to the crafted FOMO. Leading the vanguard of the propaganda is Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano. His Twitter feed is a modern-day boiler room that elevates BTC as a bigger deal than the second coming of Christ. Looking through his feed I don't know whether to laugh at his absurd claims or cry that people actually believe his garbage. His most common trope is mythologizing Bitcoin as the antidote to money-supply manipulation by the evil "Fed". This is a bullshit sentiment broadly echoed by the community.  BTC is extremely volatile which makes it a HORRIBLE asset to hedge inflation and it is blatantly ignorant of the endless number of real assets that are excellent safeguards.

The next tier of his lies are that Bitcoin is the future and the "Apex predator" of the crypto market. This is like Pomp considering the Blackberry 7290 the Apex predator of the smartphone market (maybe he does), but the statement should expose Pomp as a shameless multi-level marketing barker. While Bitcoin might be a household name, anyone with a novice-level understanding of blockchain technology recognizes it's a first-gen tech that is slow, limited, and inefficient by modern standards. While the innovation for faster, more secure, and highly functional blockchain technology is not stopping, Pomp declares that the immutable BTC at $50K is incredibly undervalued. He even forecasts the future price to be $1M a coin, which is roughly the size of the USA's GDP ðŸ™„. The sad truth of Pomp's bullshit is that he would NEVER cede Bitcoin to being of "fair value"  -- even if it jumped to $10M a token he would be tweeting that it's a "bargain + rocketship emoji". 

I hear many of Pomp's lame and laughable arguments from other HODLers regurgiating his easily disproven talking points, because he is a cunning charlatan who ascribes to a law of propoganda that if you repeat a lie often enoguh it becomes the truth. Bitcoin pumping is a much larger problem, but he's an easy target because the only thing that gets issued more than the USD these days are Pomps bullshit tweets. He is like the Russell Westbrook of Bitcoin pumping, a high-volume shooter that ignores the better options around him. I think I've wasted enough time on the ðŸ¤¡ -- I have much more to say about he Bitcoin phantasm, good and bad, that I will post in the future.

Cheers,
JFM
