To be transparent, I donâ€™t own any Bitcoin, I've never owned any, and I am way past the point of ever consider buying Bitcoin. Neither am I an expert in crypto/blockchain technology, so feel free to label me a Bitcoin hater that doesn't "get it". But if that is your attitude, have an open mind while reading.

I first paid mind to Bitcoin when Silk Road shut down in March 2013 and the attention on BTC moved its price from $30 to $100. I couldn't wrap my mind around paying $100 for something with no intrinsic value.  Looking back on it, I have huge regrets about not buying a few tokens on speculation, but my initial assessment of its value proposition has only gotten more negative. In 2021, its staggering price, the endless superior competition, and the narrow scope of utility should make it a worthless asset for new speculators. However, Bitcoin-mania persists and is stronger than ever. So what's going on?

I believe the majority of credit of Bitcoin's "value" is owed to a fervent evangelist community that espouses Bitcoin's virtues --most of which are falsehoods that purposefully conflate the novel utility of advanced cryptos with Bitcoin.  They have been successful in pushing these lies on the stupid and willingly ignorant who succumb to the crafted FOMO. Leading the vanguard of the propaganda is Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano. His Twitter feed is a modern-day boiler room that elevates BTC as a bigger deal than the second coming of Christ. Looking through his feed I don't know whether to laugh at his absurd claims or cry that people actually believe his garbage. His most common trope is mythologizing Bitcoin as the antidote to money-supply manipulation by the evil "Fed". This is a bullshit sentiment broadly echoed by the community.  BTC is extremely volatile which makes it a horrible asset to hedge inflation and it is blatantly ignorant of the endless number of stable real investments that are excellent safeguards.

The next tier of lies he spews is that Bitcoin is the future and the "Apex predator" of the crypto market. This really exposes Pomp as a shameless multi-level marketing barker. While Bitcoin might be a household name, anyone with a novice-level understanding of blockchain technology recognizes it's a first-generation tech that is slow, limited, and inefficient by modern standards. I wonder if Pomp still thinks the Blackberry 7290 is the Apex predator of the smartphone market? While the innovation in blockchain technology is not stopping, Pomp declares that the immutable BTC at $50K is incredibly undervalued with a projected price of $1M a coin (this roughly the size of the USA's GDP (eye roll emoji). The sad truth of Pomp's bullshit is that he would NEVER cede Bitcoin as fair or overvalued -- even if it jumped to $10M/coin he would be Tweeting how it's a bargain. 

I could write an entire book disputing his propanda as he is the Russell Westbrook of Bitcoin pumping: a high-volume shooter that ignores the better options that are arouund him. But I think I've wasted enough time on him and will dive in the market manipuation on my next post.
