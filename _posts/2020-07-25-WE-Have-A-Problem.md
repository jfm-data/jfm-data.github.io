Today the Globe & Mail reported corporate sponsors are abandoning WE.  Since Justin Trudeau's non-competitive $912M contract was handed to the WE Charity,
the organization's foundation has been cracking under the stress of daily damaging reports. This is terrible news for Liberals as it signals the death knell
of WE's image as a reputable charity, thereby worsening the optics of the WE contract to begin with. The fact that Canada's corporations are dropping a toxic partner should 
inspire the Liberal caucus to consider doing the same. We are not even halfway through the parliamentary
investigation and their defiance to play ball with 'aw-shucks' apologies are digging them a deeper hole. It will become a point where the damage spreads
from the individual brands of entangled ministers and pollutes the entire party.  

As of now, Bradish Chagger is making to be a convenient sacrificial lamb.  It was ostensibly her deal, but the reality is that she's a lightweight politician with very little real power. She began her political career as an N.O.B. (name on ballot) in a region where she was the party executive assistant, to running a non-existent ministry. Her presence in Trudeau's cabinet is to superficially
feed his gender and diversity branding, rather than her real-world experience and expertise. When factoring in the strength of centralized power at the PMO, the suggestion of her having any autonomy constructing this deal 
is laughable. With her exalted position being objectively underserved, it might be expected that she falls on her sword like a good soldier. However, exiting politics with a thin resume and tarnished reputation offers her limited prospects. Plus, she will is ~16 months short of the extermley generous MP pension. Given what's at personal risk, it will be interesting to see if she puts up a fight by throwing a grenade in the PMO bunker where Justin is hiding from the media and parliamentary question period. 

I see Chagger is an inevitability, but regardless of the course of her ouster, it shouldn't pacify Charlie Angus, the Bloc, or the Conservatives.
The crosshairs will move to a bigger fish, which is likely Bill Morneau given his inolvement in this scandal is perhaps criminal. But the real person who should be held accountable is Trudeau himself. Once a critic of how Harper centralized governing control in the PMO (and rightly so), Justin's grip on power makes Harper's look anemic in comparison. There is no way that Justin did not know any of this was happening, or that his immediate family were profiting greatly from the bogus demand and value of their public speaking worth. 

The entire scandel should also shine a bright spotlight on a major problem with Trudeau's government: his cabinet is full of woefully ineffectual MPs. When Trudeau annouced his gender parity cabinent in 2015, the media swooned. Very few actually questioned the creditionals of the people he was handling portflios to -- or those who he was giving them over (how dare they, "because it's 2015" of, course). With the appointment of paper tigers created the dyamic where Justin would not be held accountable by his own party. These empty suit ministers owe their unmerited positions to him and need to ride on the coattails of his easy charm and media appeal to keep them (outwardly) important. This became evident with Jody Wilson-Raybould and SNC-Lavalin scandel. JWR was objectively in a place of moral authority in the scandal, yet was eagerly kicked from cabenit and caucus for damaing Trudeau's brand for opposing his poltical interference in our leagal system. 

This is a stragic play by Gerald Butts and Trudeau. It consolidates power at the PMO, but also prevents the chance of a Paul Martin emerging. No one has a national presence, competency, practical sense, and cornder of party support to ever challenge leadership. Trudeau knows this, so he will not voluntarily admit to wrongdoing before the evidence is conclusive -- and it looks like he'll do his damndest to limit the reach of investigations (so much for "the transparent government" he promised). Even if he is caught red-handed, he will reach back to his days as a drama teacher and put
on an empathic face to say how deeply sorry he lost public trust and it was a learning experience. This seemed to work when we learned his history of blackface. Sadly, it will work again because all of Canada's political parties are dysfunctional messes that are not equipped to offer salvation from a crisis in national leadership. I hope one of them, or a white knight in the Liberal Party (paging Mark Carney), get's it together before Truedau's next inevitable scandal costs Canadians something greater.
