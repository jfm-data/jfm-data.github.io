Today [the NY Times released an artilce](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/sports/basketball/espn-rachel-nichols-maria-taylor.html) on the messy internal battle at ESPN that had "Rachel Nichols" as top trending topic on Twitter. It was curious to see why the self-proclaimed 'ally' was being raked over the coals by the social media progressives. But of course, after reading the article and others around it, the reaction was emotional and void of nuance and context. The Times disingenuously contrived Nichols' comments as disparaging of Taylor. This was ludicrous. Rachel was going out of her way to say Taylor was great and wished her success -- but as like most suburban liberals, she had a NIMBY mentality.
Secondly, it ignored the biggest piece of context that would have properly framed the conversation: Rachel wasn't losing the host of the Countdown, she was losing the host of her ESPN project, *The Jump*.

Rachel Nichols is the driving force behind ESPN's first-ever daily NBA show, *The Jump*. Rachel is both the star and producer of the show, which had kept growing every year since its launch in 2016. Its success provided Nichols the leverage to contractually make it the lead for all NBA games broadcast on ABC -- including The Finals. Maria had the job on NBA Countdown, which covered all games broadcast on ESPN. The boundaries between them were cut-and-dried. And before the NBA shut down in March 2020 and the world knew the name of George Floyd, *The Jump* **was** the NBA pre-game show on Saturday night ABC telecasts. It seems most of the world has forgotten about this, including the supposed the paper of record which omitted such a detail.

Now, the blow to Nichols that her project wasn't going to be leading the most watched NBA games of the year would have caused people with the smallest of egos in her situation to say "WTF?". Add that Nichols is a polished host with with 20+ years of experience and industry accomplishments -- ESPN pulling her/The Jump from The Finals clearly wasn't a compentency issue. Then layer on the conspicuous timing of Maria receiving the permanent role,
which happened to coincide with the heights of the BLM movement when corporations were clambering to be perceived as diversity 'allies'.
 For Rachel to form the opinion that ESPN's decision was racially motivated is an elementary deduction. Anyone in her shoes -- black, white, asian, etc -- would have rationalized the circumstances the exact the same way. The social media trolls crying racism on Twitter who believe they would think differntly in her 
situation are either intellecutally dishonest or completely delusional.  

What Nichols did was the what you have to do in a poorly run company. She was informally consulting to friendly PR advisor on what she should do to get her
 
 
to  to the expected large audience of the NBA finals she was speaking to a top PR advisor on how to solve her problem.
saw the proposed sideline assignment as a demotion,
so she sought out a political strategy to get back the role that had been contractually hers. Given the corporate politics at ESPN were described as a 'snake pit',
something that seems to be common knowledge in sports media, Nichols' motives were circumspect rather than nefarious.  

Nichols is a polished host and the driving force behind ESPN's successful daily NBA TV show, *The Jump*. She launched it It was in her contract that *The Jump* would be the pre-game show for The NBA Finals games on ABC. So losing the pre-game meant losing the opportunity to grow the brand of her project on network television. Of course she was going upset. Then factor in the conspicuous timing of Maria receiving the permanent role over her,
which happened to coincide with the heights of the BLM movement when corporations were clambering to be perceived as diversity 'allies'.
 For Rachel to form the opinion that ESPN's decision was racially motivated is an elementary deduction. It doesn't mean she was right (Maria could be the better host),
but it doesn't make her racist. It makes her human. This is typical office gossip that happens in any workplace with bad leadership. 

The charge of racism seems to be a projection from the source of the story to provide Taylor leverage for a new contract with ESPN. 
The [New York Post reported](https://nypost.com/2021/06/30/maria-taylor-espn-face-divorce-after-near-5-million-offer/) that Taylor was in an acrimonious negotiation with ESPN where she holding out for Stephen A. Smith-level money (~$8M), 
while the WWL had dropped their recent offer to the $2M-3M range. With only 3 weeks left before her deal expires, her team threw a mongoose into the ESPN snake pit.
It was a cunning political move. Not only did it raise the racial implications over the ESPN executives, but it damages
the value and image of her completion the ESPN suits could use against her.

In my view, Taylor and Nichols are both guilty of playing corporate politics at ESPN. One privately claimed affirmative action was the reason for the other's ascension,
and one publically accused that the other of being racist. Which action is worse?  Does it even matter? I have never worked in media, but I understand the egos
are big and that airtime is a zero-sum game -- a dangerous mix that I would expect is commonplace in most media environments. This particular mess reminds me of one of my [favourite quotes from Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOvKSrwSl00): **_"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die"_**. Rachel played the game by portraying herself as a female victim of reverse discrimination, while Maira played the game by portraying herself as a black female victim of racism. In the victimization battle 2021, its no contest. We just witnessed ~~Ned's~~ Rachel's head roll at the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, and soon we'll see ~~Cersei~~ Maria wearing the crown.
