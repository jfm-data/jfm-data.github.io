CNBC reporter, Jabari Young, recently published an article announcing the NBA is expecting a hefty $75B haul in the next broadcast rights deal.
To me, this is a signal that current negotiations aren't going well with exisiting partners. The language, the numbers, and even the timing of Jabari's report reeks of graft.
I suspect that TNT and ESPN are getting cold feet about re-upping at a higher valuation. Given those figures, 
who could blame the networks for behaving cautiously? Amidst conspicuous changes and uncertainly in the entertainment landscape, entering an $8 billion
a year contract through 2034 could be disastrous.  The pay-TV business model presently faces an existential threat under the cheaper and more satisfying 
services offered by tech giants and media conglomerates. Cable's one ostensible market edge their formidable competition is the inertia and conditioning of its exisiting customers. However, this
fails to apply to young people who never watched and won't subscribe. 

Just a side -- nothing represents cable's disconnect with young viewers more so than the demise of MTV's cultural relevance. From its inception in 1981,
MTV had been a pillar of teen popular culture. However, the rise of social media and YouTube stars have made them irrelevant to the children raised online. MTV's
once must-see event programming faded into a wasteland of gimmicky reality TV targeted to the last (and ageing) generation of kids who had watched earnestly.
I suspect if we indexed the year when MTV stopped being fashionable for teens, we would notice an accelerated decline in pay-TV subs happening somewhere in
the 5 to 8-year mark. A scary thought for cable TV network executives is to mentally forecast the demographics and sub counts at the ~25-year mark when the next
NBA broadcast deal would still be ripe.

Given the annual compounding effects from not adding new young subscribers should give anxiety to any network executive considering long-term deals. Then factor this with
 expected chord-cutting from price sensitive customers that are lured by the depth and variety of on-demand services. 
The scenario creates an ugly situation for the NBA's expectations. Statista tracked and forecasted US pay-TV subscribers and it is not pretty. The estimated number of subs is
expected to fall to 60M in 2025, which is a 40% drop from its peak and timing when the last deal was negotiated. If I were to apply a CAGR to 2030, the center
of the next deal, we would see subscriber declines to 47M. 

So, just from the back of the envelope math, the NBA is seeking 3X the money when the best-case scenario for its partners is earning less than half the revenue.
These companies are no longer cash cows with a natural monopoly they had been for decades, so it is difficult to imagine how they could suddenly afford to pay the asking price given the
new economic realities. Increasing prices on pay-TV subsribers is not feasible given the the higher price sensivity of competition. Now, this story could be the league posturing to combat the negative news surrounding their lacklustre ratings. If they are sincere, Adam Silver is setting up
the 

Next blog I'll share my reasoning why the streaming services will not provide the NBA leverage they teased in the CNBC article.
