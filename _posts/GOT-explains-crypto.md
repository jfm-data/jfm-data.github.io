With the disappointing final four seasons of HBO's Game of Thrones a suppressed and distant memory, I have begun re-reading with untainted pleasure. The series is renowned for its world-building, character development, and politics -- but what might be underappreciated is the subtle philosophy and wisdom embedded in the rich dialogue. Sometimes these conversations stew in my mind for days. The one gnawing on my thoughts right now is the riddle that Varys posed to Tyrion in <i>A Clash of Kings</i>.

<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px; border-radius: 6px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:35px; position: static; "> “In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword -- a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two.<br> <i>‘Do it,’ 
says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’<br> ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ 
<br>‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’</i> <b><br>So tell me – who lives and who dies?”</b></blockquote>
Varys riddle is of course a corollary for "what is power?" and who truly wields it? While I could dive deeper into the contemporary societal significance of such questions (and will in a future post), we can apply the same thought exercise to the psychology that drives pricing in the financial markets. More specifically for this post, the crowded crypto market as it relates to ~~power~~ value. 

With the increasing velocity at which new advanced blockchains are being developed and moneybeing "invested", what makes a legacy crypto token like Bitcoin the most valuable? From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is less efficient, more costly, less secure, and less practical than most of the 20,000 other blockchains that have been development since. 

So why have their holders claim it's the future of money -- or much later, digital gold? How does one even price digital gold, especially when there are other constructed "elements" with superior properties? 

From a slightly edited passage from a later Tyrion POV chapter, Varys answers the riddle:

<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px; border-radius: 6px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:35px; position: static;">  “Power is a curious thing, my lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?”


“It has crossed my mind a time or two,” Tyrion admitted. “The king, the priest, the rich man—who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It’s a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many answers. All depends on the man with the sword.”
<br>
<b>“And yet he is no one,”</b> Varys said. “He has neither crown nor gold nor favour of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.”
 <br> 
“That piece of steel is the power of life and death.”
  <br>
“Just so… yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father?”
  <br>
“Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.”
<br>
“Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they?” 
<br>
Varys smiled. “Here, then. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power resides where men believe it resides.</code> No more and no less.”
“So power is a mummer’s trick?”
<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“A shadow on the wall,” 
 <br>
 Varys murmured, “yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”</code></blockquote>

In his answer, Varys deftly describes how power is more perception than reality. We accept and submit to it because we've been convinced that it exists -- either through our own beliefs or through others. The latter has been more significant for the crypto market, as there has been a considerable influx of high net worth individuals and institutional capital in recent years driving up prices. They know there is no intrinsic value to these tokens but submit to its "value" because there enough are people who do. The entrance of deep-pocketed investors is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy to the believers who see their ~Gods~ coins as the future and one true token. But in reality, the big moeny people are buying into the greater perception of the value, which should not be confused with the value itself.

And this perception is the essence of the value of any crypto. How else could we consider one token of intangible outdated software worth $46,000? The new investors are not pricing it with a discounted cash flow model, or pricing it from increased user utility through border adoption as a... currency? Hell no. The pricing of Bitcoin and crypto perfectly crystalizes the concept of power and how it is an artificial construct of the mind. When there is big enoguh community that has convinced themselves it is an asset worth its value -- despite all its failed promisies -- it gets others to buy-in. 

Yet, in fundamental economic theory, in an unbiased marketplace of 20,000 cryptocurrencies -- with a near-infinite capacity to create new and better technology -- Bitcoin and nearly all cryptos should be rendered almost worthless.


As Varys says, a very small man can cast a very large shadow. Now there seems to be no shortage of men or fiat currency helping to make that shadow for crypto as big as possible. There are billions of advertising dollars being spent from the fee-sucking and regulated crypto exchanges that seem to be promoting the "asset class" more than their actual services that differentiate from each other. They seem to be in unison shouting "BUY CRYPTO!", and not how rational competitors typically market their product.

The amount of money have at their disposal to tell you that you should be investing may be a signal to stay out. But the undoubtedly low point is when an A-list Hollywood actor shills by associating "investing" in an unproductive asset with the greatest explorers who've gone where no man has gone before. But he's entirely wrong. Buying into the pure perception of power/value is a place everyone has been throughout history of man, but in 2022 you would think we would know better.
