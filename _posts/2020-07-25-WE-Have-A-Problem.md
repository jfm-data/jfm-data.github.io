Today the Globe & Mail reported corporate sponsors are abandoning WE.  Since Justin Trudeau's non-competitive $912M contract was handed to the WE Charity,
the organization's foundation has been cracking under the stress of daily damaging reports. This is terrible news for Liberals as it signals the death knell
of WE's image as a reputable charity, which worsening the optics of the WE contract. The fact that Canada's corporations are dropping a toxic partner should 
ignite the Liberal caucus to think about doing the same. We are not even halfway through the parliamentary
investigation and their defiance to play ball with 'aw-shucks' apologies are digging them a deeper hole. It will become a point where the damage spreads
from the individual brands of these ministers and pollutes the entire party.  

As of now, Bradish Chagger is making to be a convenient sacrificial lamb.  It was ostensibly her deal, but the reality is that she's a lightweight politician with a thin 
resume of being a former party executive assistant was started as N.O.B. (name on ballot). She runs a non-existent ministry and her presence in Trudeau's cabinet is to superficially
feed his gender and diversity branding. When factoring in the strength of centralized power at the PMO, the suggestion of her having any autonomy constructing this deal 
is laughable. With her exalted position being objectively underserved, it might be expected that she falls on her sword like a good soldier. Given the limited prospects of a life after politics with a tranished reputation, it will be interesting to see if she puts up a fight by throwing a grenade in the PMO bunker where Justin is hiding from the media and parliamentary question period. 

I seen Chagger is an inevitability, but regardless of the course of her ouster, it shouldn't pacify Charlie Angus, the Bloc, or the Conservatives.
The crosshairs will move to a bigger fish, which should be Bill Morneau given his inolvement in this scandal is possibly criminal. But the real person who should be held accountable is Trudeau himself. Once a critic of how Harper centralized governing control in the PMO (and rightly so), Justin's grip on power makes Harper's look anemic in comparison. There is no way that Justin did not know any of this was happening, or that his immediate family were profiting greatly from the bogus demand and value of their public speaking worth. 

The major problem here is how Trudeau, by hook or crook, managed to promote paper tigers to the position of Liberal Party power brokers. These empty suits ride on the coattails  of Trudeau's easy charm and media appeal to keep them relevant -- there are no Paul Martin's or Mark Carney's here. No one in the 2020 Liberal's cabenit have the competency, practical sense,
and chutzpah to do what's necessary and challenge the leadership.  Trudeau knows this, so he will not voluntarily admit to wrongdoing before the evidence is conclusive and will do his damndest to shutdown investigations (so much for "the transparent government"). Even if he is caught red-handed, he will reach back to his days as a drama teacher and put
on an empathic face to say how deeply sorry he lost public trust. Sadly it will work because all of Canada's political parties are dysfunctional messes that
are not equipped to offer salvation from a crisis in national leadership. I hope one of them, or a white knight in the Liberal Party, get's it together before the next inevitable scandal costing Canadians.
