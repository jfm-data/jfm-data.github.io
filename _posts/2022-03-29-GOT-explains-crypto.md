With the disappointing final four seasons of HBO's Game of Thrones a suppressed and distant memory, I have begun re-reading with untainted pleasure. The series is renowned for its world-building, character development, and politics -- but what might be underappreciated is the subtle philosophy and wisdom embedded in the rich dialogue. Sometimes these conversations stew in my mind for days. The one gnawing on my thoughts right now is the riddle that Varys posed to Tyrion in <i>A Clash of Kings</i>.

<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px; border-radius: 12px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:35px; position: static; "> “In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword -- a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two.<br> <i>‘Do it,’ 
says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’<br> ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ 
<br>‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this gold shall be yours.’</i> <b><br>So tell me – who lives and who dies?”</b></blockquote>
Varys riddle is of course a corollary for "what is power?" and who truly wields it? While I could dive deeper into the contemporary societal significance of such questions (and will in a future post), we can apply the same thought exercise to the psychology that drives pricing in the financial markets. More specifically for this post, the crowded crypto market as it comes to ~~power~~ value. 

With the increasing velocity at which new advanced blockchains are being developed, what makes a legacy crypto token like Bitcoin the most valuable? From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin is inefficient, costly, less secure, and less practical than the 20,000 thousand more advanced blockchains that used it as the development blueprint. 

So why do their holders claim it's the future of money -- or much later, digital gold? How does one even price digital gold, especially when there are other constructed "elements" with superior properties? 

From a slightly edited passage from a later Tyrion POV chapter, Varys answers the riddle:

<blockquote style="background-color:rgba(235, 235, 235, 0.7); font-size:20px; text-align: left; padding:24px; letter-spacing: 0px; border-radius: 15px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:35px; position: static;">  “Power is a curious thing, my lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?”


“It has crossed my mind a time or two,” Tyrion admitted. “The king, the priest, the rich man—who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It’s a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many answers. All depends on the man with the sword.”
<br>
<b>“And yet he is no one,”</b> Varys said. “He has neither crown nor gold nor favour of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.”
“That piece of steel is the power of life and death.”
“Just so… yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father?”
“Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.”

<br>
“Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they?” Varys smiled. “Some say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the gods. Others say it derives from law."


Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my headache worse?”
Varys smiled. “Here, then. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power resides where men believe it resides.</code> No more and no less.”
“So power is a mummer’s trick?”
<br>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">“A shadow on the wall,” Varys murmured, “yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”</code></blockquote>

What Varys artfully describes is that power is more perception than reality. We accept and submit to it because we've been convinced that it exists. And this perception is the essence of the value of any crypto. If not, then on what basis can we consider one token of intangible outdated software worth $46,000? 

It is worth what it's worth, not because it's a productive asset that can be priced with a discounted cash flow model (far from it), or deliver increased user utility through border adoption, but because the community has convinced itself and others that it is an asset worth its value. 

In reality, in an unbiased marketplace of 20,000 cryptocurrencies -- with a near-infinite capacity to create new and better technology -- Bitcoin and nearly all cryptos should be rendered almost worthless.

Yet the perception exists that what was 3,000 lines of code written an epoch ago in the computer science age is now worth over a trillion dollars.

As Varys says, a very small man can cast a very large shadow. Now there seems to be no shortage of men or fiat currency helping to make that shadow for crypto as big as possible. There are billions of advertising dollars being spent from the fee-sucking and regulated crypto exchanges to promote the "asset class" more than their actual services.

The amount of money they seem to have at their disposal to tell you that you should be investing may be a signal to stay out. But the undoubtedly low point is an A-list Hollywood actor shilling by associating "investing" in an unproductive asset with only theoretical-practical value, with the world's greatest explorers who've gone where no man has gone before. But he's entirely wrong. Buying into the perception of power/value is a place where every person has been in the history of humanity.
