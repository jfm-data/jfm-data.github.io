The Nova Scotia government decided to lockdown its citizens on Tuesday. This was inexplicable and frustrating news that should have warranted public backlash. With fourteen months since the initial stay-at-home order, politicians should be acting on the knowledge and data collected from the first two go-arounds. Despite them being lauded by the media (geez, I wonder why they would want us to stay home all day?), there is weak evidence to support lockdowns as an effective public health policy. It was an unprecdiecnt measure in March 2020, that allowed us to collect data and evaluate results. Despite the hymns of "trust the science", looking back and juding results is the science! And the data from spring and fall waves revealed the lockdowns only temporary contain the spread of COVID-19 while generating a host of new problems. Take the following chart that splits the relative number of COVID deaths in European countries during the first and second waves. The asymmetry of the chart is striking and the media headlines praising the success of first-wave lockdowns premature and embarrassing. These lockdowns didn't prevent these deaths, only delayed them at a much greater societial expense that will linger for months/years beyond these 'temporary' dates.

The NS government could also have focused on evaluating the success and failures of places that opted out of the second wave lockdowns and those who locked-down harder. Florida, whose Governor had the temerity to seek the counsel of renowned scientists NOT employed by the Government (how dare he seek medical advice from Harvard, Stanford, and Oxford tenured MD researchers?), decided to remove all COVID related-restrictions (including mask mandates). In contrast, California had strict and extended lockdown measures that prohibited outdoor dining and mandated outdoor mask-wearing. We got to witness a ~6 month trial in the 'Florida vs. California' policy experiment. Given weather and population similarities, this was as close to a ideally designed A/B test we could have hoped, and well, the data speaks for itself (see below). The results emboldened other policy-makers in March to follow Florida's lead though it seemed people had thier head in the sand. When Texas announced a course correction it came under a hail of criticism from a cowardly political class. Newsom called it "reckless" and Biden said it was "Neatherthal thinking". Since Abbot's announcement in early March, Texas' metrics continue to decline despite the return to normalcy and soldout baseball games.  The outcome stumped [Dr.Fauci who started pulling reasons for the downward ternd](https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/fauci-not-sure-why-texas-doesnt-have-covid-uptick-after-nixing-masks/) out of his butt.

So let's jump to the problems they are creating: so far I have seen at least a dozen local businesses shutter under these lockdowns (and there are likely hundreds on the brink of financial ruin). These are businesses that took a lifetime to build and provide livelihoods to thousands of Nova Scotians. "JuSt bAil ThEm OuT!" is not a viable short or long-term solution. Doing so is just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic as it's effectively a taxpayer-funded subsidy to the large corporations (like Amazon, Walmart, Costco) that are premitted to serve the public's needs. Not to mention that these lockdowns are creating a widening economic disparity between the working class and the white-collar professionals working from home. Those WFH'ing are not only saving thousands but they are growing their windfalls through real estate, equities, and crypto market investments (all of which are ripping). The lockdown class in Canada loves this and are cheerleading these destructive polices while singing another Government hymn of "we are in this together". Meanwhile, these lockdowns are financially crippling workers in the service and hospitality industries which will remain wounded and playing catch-up for years.  

The lockdowns are also creating a mental health crisis. This is not limited to those affected by the economic ramifications but those depressed from forced social isolation. This poorly covered crisis was worth mention in a recent quarterly report from Stats Canada that tried to contextualize the excess mortality in Canada to those not directly impacted by COVID-19 virus (source: [StatsCan](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/210310/dq210310c-eng.pdf?st=fHDKnpD3)). Tragically, they observed a 24% increase in deaths of males under 45, while only a 6% increase in the COVID vulnerable over 85 demographic. They had not direct answers but assumed it due to fall lockdowns. And in February 2021, [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00175-z) published a study that found depression and anxiety in the UK increased by a factor of four during 2020. Why are these CMOs not taking a holistic approach to public health? I mean, shutting down gyms, yoga studios, and fitness centres is exacerbating a health crisis, rather than helping us avoid one.

I am sure this is only the tip of the iceberg for the sins of the lockdowns. I am confident that years from now we'll hear about the brutal and widespread domestic abuse and child abuse that took place during this time. They will be covered by the media and sorrow without any reprimand for them deifying the bureaucrats and politicians that are culpable for the victims circumstances. To the politicians & bureaucrats, "managing numbers" to placate the fear-soaked simple minds has become priority number one and a form of self-preservation. To me, thier abject failure to assess the risks and costs of their decisions make them feckless and/or incompetent rubes. Sadly, they will likely be rewarded more terms and accolades before they get their comeuppance. I just hope it comes sooner rather than later.
