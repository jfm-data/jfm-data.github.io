On Thursday Nova Scotia's provincial government announced severe lockdown measures for the municipality of Halifax, then yesterday announced a province-wide lockdown. With 14-months since the initial stay-at-home order, there is a tsunami of evidence to conclude that this is terrible public policy with net negative consequences. At best, lockdowns only temporarily delay the spread of COVID-19, while these draconian measures create a whole host of new problems that will linger for months or years beyond the 'temporary' measures. After the second wave, we had enough data to reflect the efficacy of lockdowns. Despite them being lauded by the media (I wonder why they would want to stay home all day?), the data shows they only delayed surges.

So lets jump to the problems they are creating: So far I have seen at least a dozen businesses close related to these lockdowns, and I am sure there are hunderds on the brink of financial ruin. These are businesses that took a lifetime to build and provide livlihoods to thousands of Nova Scoitas. Perhaps new businesses will replace them in time, but meanwhile the large corporations will eat their lunch. "JuSt bAil ThEm OuT"is not a vaiable solution for dealing with the self-inflicted concequeses. Doing so is just re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic while effecitly subsidizing large corporates(like Amazon, Walmart, Costco) to serve public needs with taxpayer funds. Not to mention that these lockdowns are creating a widing economic disparity between the working class and white collar workers who work from home. Those working from home are saving thousands -- and most are growing this windfall trough real estate, equaities, and cryopto markets (which are all ripping). Meahwile these polices are financially crippiling workers in the service and hopitality inducsty.

So why are these so-called leaders deciding to Other problems: mental health problems from soical isolation, domesitc abuse, child abuse, gluttony, just ot name a few. These will have lasting concequences.
