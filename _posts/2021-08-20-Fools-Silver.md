Is the NBA in good shape? It has become a is a bit of a thorny question in NBA circles given the political bend that has imprinted the league in recent years. 
But if we strip the emotional baggage, can we all agree the product is getting worse? The egregious foul baiting, complaining to refs, god-awful replay reviews, and long drawn-out end of games situations have increasingly make it a tough watch. I am far from alone in my feelings. Fewer are watching as reflected in falling TV viewership, which can't be explained with cord-cuttig excuse. Overseeing these declines numbers and quality of play is Adam Silver. So, why doesn't he get any blame? 

Currently, Silver's reputation continues to gorge on his decision to force a feeble Donald Sterling to sell the LA Clippers. Yet, an objective reflection on the history makes
it a far cry from the profile in courage the media likes to trumpet. Sterling was the worst owner in pro sports. He had a long list of past improprieties from players and staff.
He was a leech on other owners for profiting on his equal share of league-generated revenues while perennially fielding a cheap product. No one wanted him in the league.

Silver didn't even have to deal with the sociopath. It was his jealous and aggrieved wife who held power of attorney over his estate. On the flip-side of the equation was a
desperate and uber-rich buyer who paid a once inconceivable record asking price that included letting the Sterlings retain some of the narcissistic perks of ownership.
Casting Silver as a hero for getting the reviled Sterling a $2B return on his $20M investment is completely absurd. Silver held Ace-King suited and hit a royale flush off the
flop. Going all-in was the only play, anything else would have been unadulterated incompetence.

Regardless of facts, it remains a lasting and celebrated keystone of his legacy that has placed him above criticism. This is hard to imagine given how Stern and every other
league commissioner can be useful punching bags for sports reporters. The only non-partisan media that has even touched Silver came indirectly via an anonymous agent. Last fall,
The Athletic published quotes from the agitated agent on how the league's alignment with BLM would hurt financially. The finger was pointed at Silver for giving in to the 
misguided player pressure without considering the costs, which were reflected in historically awful ratings. 


The only other instance of national media coming close to criticism was when tech industry analyst, Ben Thompson was a guest on Bill Simmons' podcast. Thompson posited that
commissioner performance is an inverse function of likeability. It was a shot that Adam Silver was failing but beloved, while NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, was winning but
hated. Bill Simmons, someone who trotted out the persistent narrative of Silver is great, seemed to have an a-ha moment, but halted with the self-awareness it might be trouble to explore it further.


So what has Silver done wrong? We can start with the on-court exploits. It's nauseating to see star players rewarder for flailing anytime a jumper is contested. Or when a star player 
drives and doesn't can't make a play they either snap their head back like a sniper got them or just fall to the floor.  It was refreshing to see the FIBA refs not buying it.

Then there is the end of game scenarios: The NBA replay review is the antithesis of entertainment. Whenever I see a player making the replay review signal I consider turning off the TV. Not only does it take too long and the refs go to it too frequently, but also still get the call wrong. Nothing was worse was when Pat Beverly swiped the ball loose from LeBron on a Christmas day game. In that situation, only a lunatic would argue it was defense ball. Yet, Pat Bev twirled his finger which caused a lengthy review that caught a frame where LeBron touched the ball last. It was totally absurd. All other basketball games would never consider that defense ball and NO ONE would have complained. Just in general, these replay reviews are out of control. In the playoffs last year it took 30 minutes to play the final 3 minutes of game time. Sometimes I think it's just the refs saying f--- you for making me review my work in front of a large captive audience.

There is more to get into, but I see Adam Silver at best a good peace-time president. He was smart not to get too involved when things were going well. Now that things are not, the NBA is in need of a David Stern type leader to get them back. Stern was unapologetically intrusive and protective of the product. When Ethan Strauss recently published an article on the dynamics of Klutch Sports on the NBA, he was asked if Stern would have let them get his happen. [His answer was a sharp "No chance"](https://houseofstrauss.substack.com/p/this-is-how-klutch-wins/comments). And I suspect tere is no chance we'll see the return of a Stern-like leader of the NBA, but hopefully there is a change that will save the sport I cannot quit watching.
