It is well past time that we say goodbye to Dr. Strang and his anxious, authoritarian, and counteractive public health policies.
The heavy-handedness of Strang's COVID restrictions should have forced a resignation months ago, yet with the media's proclivity for
fetishizing the heads of public health bureaucracies, Dr. Strang has become a local deity. 
To the public, his character is unassailable and even questioning his policies gets a Pavolian response of ad hominem attacks.
I have experienced this firsthand, as any judgement of Strang that's not glowing, is treated as hate speech.   

I wrote a post to the sub-Reddit questioning if the incoming Premier should consider replacing Dr. Strang. I listed gentle criticisms of Dr. Strang's policies and referenced pre-dated several journals that refuted his restrictions. I hoped to engage in civil debate, but the mods never published the post. So in the daily update threads, I would suggest the easing of Dr. Strang's policies. The messages would immediately get downvoted regardless of how gentle my critiques were. They all tried to label me as some alt-right crackpot. I received a few DMs one clueless person who knows nothing of science, and another to tell me my responses were no longer showing up in the thread. Soon after that, I couldn't post anything -- I was shadowbanned.
  
Sadly, Strang being an untouchable is just not contained to the mania-fuel message boards. Recently behaviour was on exhibit when the top ER doctor in Cape Breton, 
Dr. Chris Milburn, openly questioned Dr. Strang's decision to close schools. In the CBC Radio panel discussion, Dr. Milburn outlined how there is no scientific justification 
for school closures, raised concerns about the social costs, the inequities, and then called him (and Rankin) out for not performing a cost-benefit analysis on these policies. 
The host and panellist eagerly came to the defence of Strang (of course, the CBC host was framing the topic as "Did schools re-open too soon?"). 
Dr. Milburn shot down all their points with facts, reason, and logic -- yet there remained a disquiet from the panel who emanated contempt for the MD spoiling the narrative. 

Since his CBC Radio discussion, Dr. Milburn has been relentlessly attacked by Redditors, Facebookers, and social media trolls. It is hard to find any discourse about
Dr. Milburn following his criticism of Dr. Strang, that is not trying to discredit him or call him an idiot.
One Reddit user, I_AM_SQUID, posted a thread titled "Dr. Chris Milburn is an idiot". The thread was filled with personal insults and questioned his credentials, 
with no actual arguments against Dr. Milburn's points. The top comment in the thread, by user Unidan, stated that Dr. Milburn was a "f*%king idiot" and that he should "shut 
the f*%k up".  In the following days, a petition was started to remove Dr. Milburn from his position as the head of the ER in the CBRM. This petition was started by a Reddit user 
named 'HalifaxReTrend'. This petition was then posted to r/Halifax, where it gained over 500 upvotes and was seen by thousands of people. The top comments in the thread was by user I_AM_SQUID, who stated that Dr. Milburn should be fired because he is "dangerous" and "stupid".  
The media has been complicit in this character assassination of Dr. Milburn. The CBC had buried Dr. Mliburn's criticisms while amplifying Dr. Strang's rebuttal on an hourly basis, which like his devoted defenders,
did not address the science/data that Dr. Milburn references.
