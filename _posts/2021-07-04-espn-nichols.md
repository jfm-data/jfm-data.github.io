Today [the NYT released an artilce](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/sports/basketball/espn-rachel-nichols-maria-taylor.html) on ESPN's messy politics that had "Rachel Nichols" as top trending topic on Twitter. It was interesting to see the self-preceived 'ally' of social equality was being raked over the coals by the social media progressives. However, after reading the piece it seems the reaction on social media seems to have happened without listening to the private conversation and understanding its context. 
Nichols wasn't disparaging Taylor as the article disingenuously framed; she was speaking to a top PR advisor on how to solve her problem.
Nichols, someone with 20+ years of experience and accomplishments, saw the proposed sideline assignment as a demotion,
so she sought out a political strategy to get back the role that had been contractually hers. Given the corporate politics at ESPN were described as a 'snake pit',
something that seems to be common knowledge in sports media, Nichols' motives were circumspect rather than nefarious.  

Nichols is a polished host and the driving force behind ESPN's daily NBA TV show, The Jump. It would only be natural for her to think of herself
as the deserving host of the NBA Finals pre-game show on ABC. Then factor in the conspicuous timing of Maria receiving the permanent role over her,
which happened to coincide with the heights of the BLM movement when corporations prioritized actions to be perceived as diversity 'allies'.
For Rachel to form the opinion that ESPN's decision was racially motivated is an elementary deduction. It doesn't mean she was right (Maria could be the better host),
but it doesn't make her racist. It makes her human. The social media trolls crying racism on Twitter believe they would think differntly in her 
situation are either dishonest or completely delusional.  

The charge of racism seems to be a projection from the source of the story to provide Taylor leverage for a new contract with ESPN. 
The [New York Post reported](https://nypost.com/2021/06/30/maria-taylor-espn-face-divorce-after-near-5-million-offer/) that Taylor was in an acrimonious negotiation with ESPN where she expected Stephen A. Smith-level money (~$8M), 
but the WWL had dropped their offer to the $2M-3M range. With only 3 weeks left before her deal expires, her team threw a mongoose into the ESPN snake pit.
It was a cunning political move in retaliation of the Post's story. Not only does it raise the racial implications over the ESPN executives, it damages
the value and image of her completion the ESPN suits could use against her.

In my view, Taylor and Nichols are both guilty of playing corporate politics at ESPN. One privately claimed affirmative action was the reason for the other's ascension,
and one publically accused that the other of being racist. Which action is worse?  Does it even matter? I have never worked in media, but I understand the egos
are big and that airtime is a zero-sum game -- a dangerous mix that would create messy power struggles that I would expect in most media environments. This particular one reminds me of one of my [favourite quotes from Game of Thrones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOvKSrwSl00): **_"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die"_**. Rachel played the game by portraying herself as a female victim of reverse discrimination, while Maira played the game by portraying herself black female victim of racism. In the victimization battle 2021, its no contest. We just witnessed ~~Ned's~~ Rachel's head roll at the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, and soon we'll see ~~Cersei~~ Maria wearing the crown.
