NBA TV Ratings are not a virtue.

Adam Silver is a peacetime president who is no longer effective as the stewarding the league. His reluctance to make any decisions that would warrant even mild criticisms from the players union has created circumstances that the league will struggle to overcome while it deals with failing ratings.


Currently, Silver's reputation continues to gorge on his decision to force an infirm Donald Sterling to sell the Clippers for a record two billion dollars. I found that Silver being cast as a hero for getting the reviled Donland Sterling a $2B return on his $20M investment completely absurd.  An objective reflection on the situation makes it a far cry from the profile in courage the media likes to trumpet. Sterling was the worst owner in pro sports and had multiple prior accusations against him. His upset and jealous wife held lost his power of attorney. Plus she found a desperate and uber-rich buyer who met a once inconceivable asking price which included retaining many of the egotistic perks of being an owner.
